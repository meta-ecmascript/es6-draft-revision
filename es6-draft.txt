Introduction

This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the
most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The
language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in
that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent
browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with
Internet Explorer 3.0.

The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first
edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly
of June 1997.

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the
fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC
16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved
the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC
16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in
nature.

The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular
expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch
exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric
output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming
internationalization facilities and future language growth. The third
edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General
Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June
2002.

After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive
adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the
programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers.
Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript.
Although that work was not completed and not published[1] as the fourth
edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language.
The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5^th^ edition)
codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that
have become common among browser implementations and added support for
new features that had emerged since the publication of the third
edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation
and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes,
additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object
encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking
and program security.

The edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard is fully aligned with the
third edition of the international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011.

This present sixth edition of the Standard………

ECMAScript is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is
not complete. Significant technical enhancement will continue with
future editions of this specification.

This Ecma Standard has been adopted by the General Assembly of <month>
<year>.

ECMAScript Language Specification



SCOPE


This Standard defines the ECMAScript scripting language.



CONFORMANCE


A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all
the types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax
and semantics described in this specification.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must interpret source code
input in conformance with the Unicode Standard, Version 5.1.0 or later
and ISO/IEC 10646. If the adopted ISO/IEC 10646-1 subset is not
otherwise specified, it is presumed to be the Unicode set, collection
10646.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript that provides an application
programming interface that supports programs that need to adapt to the
linguistic and cultural conventions used by different human languages
and countries must implement the interface defined by the most recent
edition of ECMA-402 that is compatible with this specification.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may provide additional types,
values, objects, properties, and functions beyond those described in
this specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of
ECMAScript may provide properties not described in this specification,
and values for those properties, for objects that are described in this
specification.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may support program and
regular expression syntax not described in this specification. In
particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript may support
program syntax that makes use of the “future reserved words” listed in
subclause 11.6.2.2 of this specification.

OVERVIEW


This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript
language.

ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing
computations and manipulating computational objects within a host
environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be
computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this
specification for input of external data or output of computed results.
Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an
ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other
facilities described in this specification but also certain
environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond
the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide
certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can
be called from an ECMAScript program.

A _SCRIPTING LANGUAGE_ is a programming language that is used to
manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing
system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available
through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for
exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the
existing system is said to provide a host environment of objects and
facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language.
A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and
non-professional programmers. ECMAScript was originally designed to be
used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general
purpose programming language.

ECMAScript was originally designed to be a _WEB SCRIPTING LANGUAGE_,
providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform
server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture.
ECMAScript is now used both as a general propose programming language
and to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host
environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document
apart from any particular host environment.

Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other
programming languages; in particular C, Java, Self, and Scheme as
described in:

Web Scripting

A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side
computation including, for instance, objects that represent windows,
menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history,
cookies, and input/output. Further, the host environment provides a
means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page
and image loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form
submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML
and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and
fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to
user interaction and there is no need for a main program.

A web server provides a different host environment for server-side
computation including objects representing requests, clients, and files;
and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and
server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation
between the client and server while providing a customized user
interface for a Web-based application.

Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own
host environment, completing the ECMAScript execution environment.


ECMAScript Overview

The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript—not all parts of the
language are described. This overview is not part of the standard
proper.

ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are
provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of
communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an OBJECT is a collection of
PROPERTIES each with zero or more ATTRIBUTES that determine how each
property can be used—for example, when the Writable attribute for a
property is set to FALSE, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to
change the value of the property fails. Properties are containers that
hold other objects, _PRIMITIVE VALUES_, or FUNCTIONS. A primitive
value is a member of one of the following built-in types: UNDEFINED,
NULL, BOOLEAN, NUMBER, SYMBOL and STRING; an object is a member of the
remaining built-in type OBJECT; and a function is a callable object. A
function that is associated with an object via a property is a METHOD.

ECMAScript defines a collection of _BUILT-IN OBJECTS_ that round out the
definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the
global object, the OBJECT object, the FUNCTION object, the ARRAY object,
the STRING object, the BOOLEAN object, the NUMBER object, the MATH
object, the DATE object, the REGEXP object, the JSON object, and the
Error objects ERROR, EVALERROR, RANGEERROR, REFERENCEERROR, SYNTAXERROR,
TYPEERROR and URIERROR.

ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in OPERATORS. ECMAScript
operators include various unary operations, multiplicative operators,
additive operators, bitwise shift operators, relational operators,
equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical operators,
assignment operators, and the comma operator.

ECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax
is relaxed to enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language.
For example, a variable is not required to have its type declared nor
are types associated with properties, and defined functions are not
required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to
them.

Objects

ECMAScript objects are not fundamentally class-based such as those in
C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways
including via a literal notation or via CONSTRUCTORS which create
objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by
assigning initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a
function that has a property named “PROTOTYPE” that is used to implement
_PROTOTYPE-BASED INHERITANCE_ and _SHARED PROPERTIES_. Objects are
created by using constructors in NEW expressions; for example, NEW
DATE(2009,11) creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor without
using NEW has consequences that depend on the constructor. For example,
DATE() produces a string representation of the current date and time
rather than an object.

Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called
the object’s prototype) to the value of its constructor’s “PROTOTYPE”
property. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit
reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the _prototype
chain_. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that
reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the
prototype chain that contains a property of that name. In other words,
first the object mentioned directly is examined for such a property; if
that object contains the named property, that is the property to which
the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named
property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.

Figure 1 — Object/Prototype Relationships

In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried
by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of
structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are
carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all
inherited.

All objects that do not directly contain a particular property that
their prototype contains share that property and its value. Figure 1
illustrates this:

CF is a constructor (and also an object). Five objects have been created
by using NEW expressions: CF~1~, CF~2~, CF~3~, CF~4~, and CF~5~. Each of
these objects contains properties named q1 and q2. The dashed lines
represent the implicit prototype relationship; so, for example, CF~3~’s
prototype is CF~P~. The constructor, CF, has two properties itself,
named P1 and P2, which are not visible to CF~P~, CF~1~, CF~2~, CF~3~,
CF~4~, or CF~5~. The property named CFP1 in CF~P~ is shared by CF~1~,
CF~2~, CF~3~, CF~4~, and CF~5~ (but not by CF), as are any properties
found in CF~P~’s implicit prototype chain that are not named q1, q2, or
CFP1. Notice that there is no implicit prototype link between CF and
CF~P~.

Unlike most class-based object languages, properties can be added to
objects dynamically by assigning values to them. That is, constructors
are not required to name or assign values to all or any of the
constructed object’s properties. In the above diagram, one could add a
new shared property for CF~1~, CF~2~, CF~3~, CF~4~, and CF~5\ ~by
assigning a new value to the property in CF~P~.

Although ECMAScript objects are not inherently class-based, it is often
convenient to define class-like abstractions based upon a common pattern
of constructor functions, prototype objects, and methods. The ECMAScript
built-in object themselves follow such a class-like pattern. The
ECMAScript language includes syntatic class definitions that permit
programmers to concisely define objects that conform to the same
class-like abstraction pattern used by the built-in objects.

The Strict Variant of ECMAScript

The ECMAScript Language recognizes the possibility that some users of
the language may wish to restrict their usage of some features available
in the language. They might do so in the interests of security, to avoid
what they consider to be error-prone features, to get enhanced error
checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this
possibility, ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The
strict variant of the language excludes some specific syntactic and
semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the
detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also specifies
additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error
exceptions in situations that are not specified as errors by the
non-strict form of the language.

The strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the _strict
mode_ of the language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode
syntax and semantics of ECMAScript is explicitly made at the level of
individual ECMAScript code units. Because strict mode is selected at the
level of a syntactic code unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions
that have local effect within such a code unit. Strict mode does not
restrict or modify any aspect of the ECMAScript semantics that must
operate consistently across multiple code units. A complete ECMAScript
program may be composed for both strict mode and non-strict mode
ECMAScript code units. In this case, strict mode only applies when
actually executing code that is defined within a strict mode code unit.

In order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation
must implement both the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the
strict mode variant of the ECMAScript language as defined by this
specification. In addition, an implementation must support the
combination of unrestricted and strict mode code units into a single
composite program.


Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions
apply.

4.3.1

type

set of data values as defined in clause 6 of this specification

4.3.2

primitive value

member of one of the types Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, Symbol, or
String as defined in clause 6

NOTE A primitive value is a datum that is represented directly at the
lowest level of the language implementation.

4.3.3

object

member of the type Object

NOTE An object is a collection of properties and has a single prototype
object. The prototype may be the null value.

constructor

function object that creates and initializes objects

NOTE The value of a constructor’s “prototype” property is a prototype
object that is used to implement inheritance and shared properties.

4.3.5

prototype

object that provides shared properties for other objects

NOTE When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly
references the constructor’s “PROTOTYPE” property for the purpose of
resolving property references. The constructor’s “PROTOTYPE” property
can be referenced by the program expression constructor.PROTOTYPE, and
properties added to an object’s prototype are shared, through
inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype. Alternatively, a new
object may be created with an explicitly specified prototype by using
the OBJECT.CREATE built-in function.

4.3.6

ordinary object

object that has the default behaviour for the essential internal methods
that must be supported by all objects.

4.3.7

exotic object

object that has does not have the default behaviour for one or more of
the essential internal methods that must be supported by all objects.

NOTE Any object that is not an ordinary object is an exotic object.

4.3.8

standard object

object whose semantics are defined by this specification.

4.3.9

built-in object

object supplied by an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host
environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an

String value

primitive value that is a finite ordered sequence of zero or more 16-bit
unsigned integer

NOTE A String value is a member of the String type. Each integer value

NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS


Syntactic and Lexical Grammars

Context-Free Grammars

A _context-free grammar_ consists of a number of productions. Each
production has an abstract symbol called a nonterminal as its
_left-hand side_, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and
terminal symbols as its _right-hand side_. For each grammar, the
terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.

A _chain production_ is a production that has exactly one nonterminal
symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.

Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished
nonterminal, called the _goal symbol_, a given context-free grammar
specifies a language, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible
sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing
any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production
for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.

The Lexical and RegExp Grammars

A _lexical grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in clause 11. This grammar
has as its terminal symbols Unicode code points that conform to the
rules for SourceCharacter defined in 10.1. It defines a set of
productions, starting from the goal symbol InputElementDiv or
InputElementRegExp, that describe how sequences of such code points
are translated into a sequence of input elements.

Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal
symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called
ECMAScript tokens. These tokens are the reserved words, identifiers,
literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line
terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of
the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic
semicolon insertion (11.9). Simple white space and single-line comments
are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for the
syntactic grammar. A MultiLineComment (that is, a comment of the form
“/*…*/” regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise
simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a
MultiLineComment contains one or more line terminators, then it is
replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream
of input elements for the syntactic grammar.

A _RegExp grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in 21.2.1. This grammar also
has as its terminal symbols the code points as defined by
SourceCharacter. It defines a set of productions, starting from the
goal symbol Pattern, that describe how sequences of code points are
translated into regular expression patterns.

Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by
having two colons “::” as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp
grammars share some productions.

The Numeric String Grammar

Another grammar is used for translating Strings into numeric values.
This grammar is similar to the part of the lexical grammar having to do
with numeric literals and has as its terminal symbols SourceCharacter.
This grammar appears in 7.1.3.1.

Productions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having
three colons “:::” as punctuation.

The Syntactic Grammar

The _syntactic grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in clauses 11, 12, 13,
14, and 15. This grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical
grammar as its terminal symbols (5.1.2). It defines a set of
productions, starting from the goal symbol Script, that describe how
sequences of tokens can form syntactically correct independent
components of an ECMAScript programs.

When a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript script, it
is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application
of the lexical grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by
a single application of the syntactic grammar. The script is
syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements
cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal nonterminal Script,
with no tokens left over.

Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just
one colon “:” as punctuation.

The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 is
actually not a complete account of which token sequences are accepted as
correct ECMAScript scripts. Certain additional token sequences are also
accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only
semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before
line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that
are described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line
terminator character appears in certain “awkward” places.

In certain cases in order to avoid ambiguities the syntactic grammar
uses generalized productions that permit token sequences that are not
valid ECMAScript scripts. For example, this technique is used for object
literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more
restrictive _supplemental grammar_ is provided that further restricts
the acceptable token sequences. In certain contexts, when explicitly
specific, the input elements corresponding to such a production are
parsed again using a goal symbol of a supplemental grammar. The script
is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements
cannot be parsed as a single instance of the supplemental goal symbol,
with no tokens left over.

Grammar Notation

Terminal symbols of the lexical, RegExp, and numeric string grammars,
and some of the terminal symbols of the other grammars, are shown in
FIXED WIDTH font, both in the productions of the grammars and throughout
this specification whenever the text directly refers to such a terminal
symbol. These are to appear in a script exactly as written. All terminal
symbol code points specified in this way are to be understood as the
appropriate Unicode code points from the Basic Latin range, as opposed
to any similar-looking code points from other Unicode ranges.

Nonterminal symbols are shown in italic type. The definition of a
nonterminal (also called a “production”) is introduced by the name of
the nonterminal being defined followed by one or more colons. (The
number of colons indicates to which grammar the production belongs.) One
or more alternative right-hand sides for the nonterminal then follow on
succeeding lines. For example, the syntactic definition:

WhileStatement :

WHILE ( Expression ) Statement

states that the nonterminal WhileStatement represents the token WHILE,
followed by a left parenthesis token, followed by an Expression,
followed by a right parenthesis token, followed by a Statement. The
occurrences of Expression and Statement are themselves nonterminals.
As another example, the syntactic definition:

ArgumentList :

AssignmentExpression
ArgumentList , AssignmentExpression

states that an ArgumentList may represent either a single
AssignmentExpression or an ArgumentList, followed by a comma,
followed by an AssignmentExpression. This definition of ArgumentList
is recursive, that is, it is defined in terms of itself. The result is
that an ArgumentList may contain any positive number of arguments,
separated by commas, where each argument expression is an
AssignmentExpression. Such recursive definitions of nonterminals are
common.

The subscripted suffix “~opt~”, which may appear after a terminal or
nonterminal, indicates an optional symbol. The alternative containing
the optional symbol actually specifies two right-hand sides, one that
omits the optional element and one that includes it. This means that:

VariableDeclaration :

BindingIdentifier Initializer~opt~

is a convenient abbreviation for:

VariableDeclaration :

BindingIdentifier
BindingIdentifier Initializer

and that:

IterationStatement :

FOR ( LexicalDeclaration Expression~opt~ ; Expression~opt~ ) Statement

is a convenient abbreviation for:

IterationStatement :

FOR ( LexicalDeclaration ; Expression~opt~ ) Statement
FOR ( LexicalDeclaration Expression ; Expression~opt~ ) Statement

which in turn is an abbreviation for:

IterationStatement :

FOR ( LexicalDeclaration ; ) Statement
FOR ( LexicalDeclaration ; Expression ) Statement
FOR ( LexicalDeclaration Expression ; ) Statement
FOR ( LexicalDeclaration Expression ; Expression ) Statement

so, in this example, the nonterminal IterationStatement actually has
four alternative right-hand sides.

A production may be parameterized by a subscripted annotation of the
form “~[parameters]~”, which may appear as a suffix to the nonterminal
symbol defined by the production. “~parameters~” may be either a single
name or a comma separated list of names. A parameterized production is
shorthand for a set of productions defining all combinations of the
parameter names, preceeded by an underscore, appended to the
parameterized nonterminal symbol. This means that:

StatementList~[Return]~ :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

is a convenient abbreviation for:

StatementList :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

StatementList_Return :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

and that:

StatementList~[Return,\ In]~ :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

is an abbreviation for:

StatementList :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

StatementList_Return :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

StatementList_In :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

StatementListReturnIn :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

Multiple parameters produce a combinatory number of productions, not all
of which are necessarily referenced in a complete grammar.

References to nonterminals on the right hand side of a production can
also be parameterized. For example:

StatementList :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement~[In]~

is equivalent to saying:

StatementList :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement_In

A nonterminal reference may have both a parameter list and an “~opt~”
suffix. For example:

VariableDeclaration :

BindingIdentifier Initializer~[In]opt~

is an abbreviation for:

VariableDeclaration :

BindingIdentifier
BindingIdentifier Initializer_In

Prefixing a parameter name with “~?~” on a right hand side nonterminal
reference makes that parameter value dependent upon the occurrence of
the parameter name on the reference to the current production’s left
hand side symbol. For example:

VariableDeclaration~[In]~ :

BindingIdentifier Initializer~[?In]~

is an abbreviation for:

VariableDeclaration :

BindingIdentifier Initializer

VariableDeclaration_In :

BindingIdentifier Initializer_In

If a right hand side alternative is prefixed with “[+parameter]” that
alternative is only available if the named parameter was used in
referencing the production’s nonterminal symbol. If a right hand side
alternative is prefixed with “[~parameter]” that alternative is only
available if the named parameter was not used in referencing the
production’s nonterminal symbol. This means that:

StatementList~[Return]~ :

[+Return] ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

is an abbreviation for:

StatementList :

ExpressionStatement

StatementList_Return :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

and that

StatementList~[Return]~ :

[~Return] ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

is an abbreviation for:

StatementList :

ReturnStatement
ExpressionStatement

StatementList_Return :

ExpressionStatement

When the words “ONE OF” follow the colon(s) in a grammar definition,
they signify that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or
lines is an alternative definition. For example, the lexical grammar for
ECMAScript contains the production:

NonZeroDigit :: ONE OF

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

which is merely a convenient abbreviation for:

NonZeroDigit ::

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

If the phrase “[empty]” appears as the right-hand side of a production,
it indicates that the production's right-hand side contains no terminals
or nonterminals.

If the phrase “[lookahead ∉ set]” appears in the right-hand side of a
production, it indicates that the production may not be used if the
immediately following input token is a member of the given set. The
set can be written as a list of terminals enclosed in curly braces.
For convenience, the set can also be written as a nonterminal, in which
case it represents the set of all terminals to which that nonterminal
could expand. If the set consists of a single terminal the phrase
“[lookahead ≠ terminal]” may be used.

For example, given the definitions

DecimalDigit :: ONE OF

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

DecimalDigits ::

DecimalDigit
DecimalDigits DecimalDigit

the definition

LookaheadExample ::

N [lookahead ∉ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}] DecimalDigits
DecimalDigit [lookahead ∉ DecimalDigit ]

matches either the letter N followed by one or more decimal digits the
first of which is even, or a decimal digit not followed by another
decimal digit.

If the phrase “[no LineTerminator here]” appears in the right-hand
side of a production of the syntactic grammar, it indicates that the
production is _a restricted production_: it may not be used if a
LineTerminator occurs in the input stream at the indicated position.
For example, the production:

ThrowStatement :

THROW [no LineTerminator here] Expression ;

indicates that the production may not be used if a LineTerminator
occurs in the script between the THROW token and the Expression.

Unless the presence of a LineTerminator is forbidden by a restricted
production, any number of occurrences of LineTerminator may appear
between any two consecutive tokens in the stream of input elements
without affecting the syntactic acceptability of the script.

The lexical grammar has multiple goal symbols and the appropriate goal
symbol to use depends upon the syntactic grammar context. If a phrase of
the form “[Lexical goal LexicalGoalSymbol]” appears on the
right-hand-side of a syntactic production then the next token must be
lexically recognized using the indicated goal symbol. In the absence of
such a phrase the default lexical goal symbol is used.

When an alternative in a production of the lexical grammar or the
numeric string grammar appears to be a multi-code point token, it
represents the sequence of code points that would make up such a token.

The right-hand side of a production may specify that certain expansions
are not permitted by using the phrase “BUT NOT” and then indicating the
expansions to be excluded. For example, the production:

Identifier ::

IdentifierName BUT NOT ReservedWord

means that the nonterminal Identifier may be replaced by any sequence
of code points that could replace IdentifierName provided that the
same sequence of code points could not replace ReservedWord.

Finally, a few nonterminal symbols are described by a descriptive phrase
in sans-serif type in cases where it would be impractical to list all
the alternatives:

SourceCharacter ::

any Unicode code point


Algorithm Conventions

The specification often uses a numbered list to specify steps in an
algorithm. These algorithms are used to precisely specify the required
semantics of ECMAScript language constructs. The algorithms are not
intended to imply the use of any specific implementation technique. In
practice, there may be more efficient algorithms available to implement
a given feature.

Algorithms may be explicitly parameterized, in which case the names and
usage of the parameters must be provided as part of the algorithm’s
definition. In order to facilitate their use in multiple parts of this
specification, some algorithms, called abstract operations, are
named and written in parameterized functional form so that they may be
referenced by name from within other algorithms.

Algorithms may be associated with productions of one of the ECMAScript
grammars. A production that has multiple alternative definitions will
typically have a distinct algorithm for each alternative. When an
algorithm is associated with a grammar production, it may reference the
terminal and nonterminal symbols of the production alternative as if
they were parameters of the algorithm. When used in this manner,
nonterminal symbols refer to the actual alternative definition that is
matched when parsing the script souce code.

When an algorithm is associated with a production alternative, the
alternative is typically shown without any “[ ]” grammar annotations.
Such annotations should only affect the syntactic recognition of the
alternative and have no effect on the associated semantics for the
alternative.

Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all chain productions have an
implicit associated definition for every algorithm that might be applied
to that production’s left-hand side nonterminal. The implicit definition
simply reapplies the same algorithm name with the same parameters, if
any, to the chain production’s sole right-hand side nonterminal and then
result. For example, assume there is a production:

Block :

{ StatementList }

but there is no corresponding Evaluation algorithm that is explicitly
specified for that production. If in some algorithm there is a statement
of the form: “Return the result of evaluating Block” it is implicit
that an Evaluation algorithm exists of the form:

RUNTIME SEMANTICS: EVALUATION

Block : { StatementList }

1.  Return the result of evaluating StatementList.

For clarity of expression, algorithm steps may be subdivided into
sequential substeps. Substeps are indented and may themselves be further
divided into indented substeps. Outline numbering conventions are used
to identify substeps with the first level of substeps labelled with
lower case alphabetic characters and the second level of substeps
labelled with lower case roman numerals. If more than three levels are
required these rules repeat with the fourth level using numeric labels.
For example:

1.  Top-level step

    a.  Substep.

    b.  Substep.

        i.  Subsubstep.

            1.  Subsubsubstep

                a.  Subsubsubsubstep

                    i.  Subsubsubsubsubstep

A step or substep may be written as an “if” predicate that conditions
its substeps. In this case, the substeps are only applied if the
predicate is true. If a step or substep begins with the word “else”, it
is a predicate that is the negation of the preceding “if” predicate step
at the same level.

A step may specify the iterative application of its substeps.

A step may assert an invariant condition of its algorithm. Such
assertions are used to make explicit algorithmic invariants that would
otherwise be implicit. Such assertions add no additional semantic
requirements and hence need not be checked by an implementation. They
are used simply to clarify algorithms.

Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, negation,
multiplication, division, and the mathematical functions defined later
in this clause should always be understood as computing exact
mathematical results on mathematical real numbers, which do not include
infinities and do not include a negative zero that is distinguished from
positive zero. Algorithms in this standard that model floating-point
arithmetic include explicit steps, where necessary, to handle infinities
and signed zero and to perform rounding. If a mathematical operation or
function is applied to a floating-point number, it should be understood
as being applied to the exact mathematical value represented by that
floating-point number; such a floating-point number must be finite, and
if it is +0 or −0 then the corresponding mathematical value is simply 0.

The mathematical function abs(x) produces the absolute value of x,
which is −x if x is negative (less than zero) and otherwise is x
itself.

The mathematical function sign(x) produces 1 if x is positive and −1
if x is negative. The sign function is not used in this standard for
cases when x is zero.

The mathematical function min(x~1~, x~2~, ..., x~n~) produces the
mathematically smallest of x~1~ through x~n~.

The notation “x modulo y” (y must be finite and nonzero) computes
a value k of the same sign as y (or zero) such that abs(k) <
abs(y) and x_−_k = q × y for some integer q.

The mathematical function floor(x) produces the largest integer
(closest to positive infinity) that is not larger than x.

NOTE floor(x) = x_−(_x modulo 1).


Static Semantic Rules

Context-free grammars are not sufficiently powerful to express all the
rules that define whether a stream of input elements form a valid
ECMAScript script that may be evaluated. In some situations additional
rules are needed that may be expressed using either ECMAScript algorithm
conventions or prose requirements. Such rules are always associated with
a production of a grammar and are called the _static semantics_ of the
production.

Static Semantic Rules have names and typically are defined using an
algorithm. Named Static Semantic Rules are associated with grammar
productions and a production that has multiple alternative definitions
will typically have for each alternative a distinct algorithm for each
applicable named static semantic rule.

Unless otherwise specified every grammar production alternative in this
specification implicitly has a definition for a static semantic rule
named Contains which takes an argument named symbol whose value is a
terminal or nonterminal of the grammar that includes the associated
production. The default definition of Contains is:

1.  For each terminal and nonterminal grammar symbol, sym, in the
    definition of this production do

    a.  If sym is the same grammar symbol as symbol, return TRUE.

    b.  If sym is a nonterminal, then

        i.  Let contained be the result of sym Contains symbol.

        ii. If contained is TRUE, return TRUE.

2.  Return FALSE.

The above definition is explicitly over-ridden for specific productions.

A special kind of static semantic rule is an Early Error Rule. Early
error rules define early error conditions (see clause 16) that are
associated with specific grammar productions. Evaluation of most early
error rules are not explicitly invoked within the algorithms of this
specification. A conforming implementation must, prior to the first
evaluation of a Script, validate all of the early error rules of the
productions used to parse that Script. If any of the early error rules
are violated the Script is invalid and cannot be evaluated.



ECMASCRIPT DATA TYPES AND VALUES 


Algorithms within this specification manipulate values each of which has
an associated type. The possible value types are exactly those defined
in this clause. Types are further subclassified into ECMAScript language
types and specification types.

Within this specification, the notation “Type(x)” is used as shorthand
for “the type of x” where “type” refers to the ECMAScript language and
specification types defined in this clause.


ECMAScript Language Types

An ECMAScript language type corresponds to values that are directly
manipulated by an ECMAScript programmer using the ECMAScript language.
The ECMAScript language types are Undefined, Null, Boolean, String,
Symbol, Number, and Object. An ECMAScript language value is a value that
is characterized by an ECMAScript language type.

The Undefined Type

The Undefined type has exactly one value, called UNDEFINED. Any variable
that has not been assigned a value has the value UNDEFINED.

The Null Type

The Null type has exactly one value, called NULL.

The Boolean Type

The Boolean type represents a logical entity having two values, called
TRUE and FALSE.

The String Type

The String type is the set of all finite ordered sequences of zero or
more 16-bit unsigned integer values (“elements”). The String type is
generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript
program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16
code unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within
the sequence. These positions are indexed with nonnegative integers. The
first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element (if any) at index
1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements (i.e.,
16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore
contains no elements.

Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is
interpreted as a single UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not
place any restrictions or requirements on the sequence of code units in
a String value, so they may be ill-formed when interpreted as UTF-16
code unit sequences. Operations that do not interpret String contents
treat them as sequences of undifferentiated 16-bit unsigned integers. No
operations ensure that Strings are in a normalized form. Only operations
that are explicitly specified to be language or locale sensitive produce
language-sensitive results

NOTE The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of
Strings as simple and high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source
code is in Normalized Form C, string literals are guaranteed to also be
normalized, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape sequences.

Some operations interpret String contents as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code
points. In that case the interpretation is:

-   A code unit in the range 0 to 0xD7FF or in the range 0xE000 to
    0xFFFF is interpreted as a code point with the same value.

-   A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit c1 is in
    the range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF and the second code unit c2 is in the
    range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF, is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a
    code point with the value (c1 - 0xD800) × 0x400 + (c2 –
    0xDC00) + 0x10000.

-   A code unit that is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF, but is not part
    of a surrogate pair, is interpreted as a code point with the same
    value.

The Symbol Type

The Symbol type is the set of all non-String values that may be used as
the key of an Object property (6.1.7).

Each possible Symbol values is unique and immutable.

Each Symbol value immutably holds an associated value called
[[Description]] that is either UNDEFINED or a String value.

Well-Known Symbols

Well-known symbols are built-in Symbol values that are explicitly
referenced by algorithms of this specification. They are typically used
as the keys of properties whose values serve as extension points of a
specification algorithm. Unless otherwise specified, well-known symbols
values are shared by all Code Realms (8.1.2.5).

Within this specification a well-known symbol is referred to by using a
notation of the form @@name, where “name” is one of the values listed in
Table 1.

  ----------------------- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Number Type

The Number type has exactly 18437736874454810627 (that is,
2^64^−2^53^+3) values, representing the double-precision 64-bit format
IEEE 754 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary
Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9007199254740990 (that is,
2^53^−2) distinct “Not-a-Number” values of the IEEE Standard are
represented in ECMAScript as a single special NAN value. (Note that the
NAN value is produced by the program expression NAN.) In some
implementations, external code might be able to detect a difference
between various Not-a-Number values, but such behaviour is
implementation-dependent; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are
indistinguishable from each other.

There are two other special values, called POSITIVE INFINITY and
NEGATIVE INFINITY. For brevity, these values are also referred to for
expository purposes by the symbols +∞ and −∞, respectively. (Note that
these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions
+INFINITY (or simply INFINITY) and -INFINITY.)

The other 18437736874454810624 (that is, 2^64^−2^53^) values are called
the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are
negative numbers; for every finite positive Number value there is a
corresponding negative value having the same magnitude.

Note that there is both a POSITIVE ZERO and a NEGATIVE ZERO. For
brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by
the symbols +0 and −0, respectively. (Note that these two different zero
Number values are produced by the program expressions +0 (or simply 0)
and -0.)

The 18437736874454810622 (that is, 2^64^−2^53^−2) finite nonzero values
are of two kinds:

18428729675200069632 (that is, 2^64^−2^54^) of them are normalized,
having the form

  s × m × 2^e^

where s is +1 or −1, m is a positive integer less than 2^53^ but not
less than 2^52^, and e is an integer ranging from −1074 to 971,
inclusive.

The remaining 9007199254740990 (that is, 2^53^−2) values are
denormalized, having the form

  s × m × 2^e^

where s is +1 or −1, m is a positive integer less than 2^52^, and
e is −1074.

Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no
greater than 2^53^ are representable in the Number type (indeed, the
integer 0 has two representations, +0 and -0).

A finite number has an _odd significand_ if it is nonzero and the
integer m used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is
odd. Otherwise, it has an _even significand_.

In this specification, the phrase “the Number value for x” where x
represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even
be an irrational number such as π) means a Number value chosen in the
following manner. Consider the set of all finite values of the Number
type, with −0 removed and with two additional values added to it that
are not representable in the Number type, namely 2^1024^ (which is +1 ×
2^53^ × 2^971^) and −2^1024^ (which is −1 × 2^53^ × 2^971^). Choose the
member of this set that is closest in value to x. If two values of the
set are equally close, then the one with an even significand is chosen;
for this purpose, the two extra values 2^1024^ and −2^1024^ are
considered to have even significands. Finally, if 2^1024^ was chosen,
replace it with +∞; if −2^1024^ was chosen, replace it with −∞; if +0
was chosen, replace it with −0 if and only if x is less than zero; any
other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the Number value for
x. (This procedure corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE
754 “round to nearest” mode.)

Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in the range −2^31^
through 2^31^−1, inclusive, or in the range 0 through 2^32^−1,
inclusive. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first
convert each such value to one of 2^32^ integer values. See the
descriptions of the ToInt32 and ToUint32 operators in 7.1.5 and 7.1.6,
respectively.

The Object Type

An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is
either a data property, or an accessor property:

-   A _data property_ associates a key value with an ECMAScript language
    value and a set of Boolean attributes.

-   An _accessor property_ associates a key value with one or two
    accessor functions, and a set of Boolean attributes. The accessor
    functions are used to store or retrieve an ECMAScript language value
    that is associated with the property.

Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either an
ECMAScript String value or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values,
including the empty string, are valid as property keys.

An _integer index_ is a String-valued property key that is a canonical
numeric String (see 7.1.16) and whose numeric value is either +0 or a
positive integer ≤ 2^53^−1. An _array index_ is an integer index whose
numeric value i is in the range +0 ≤ i < 2^32^−1.

Property keys are used to access properties and their values. There are
two kinds of access for properties: get and set, corresponding to
value retrieval and assignment, respectively. The properties accessible
via get and set access includes both _own properties_ that are a direct
part of an object and _inherited properties_ which are provided by
another associated object via a property inheritance relationship.
Inherited properties may be either own or inherited properties of the
associated object. Each own properties of an object must each have a key
value that is distinct from the key values of the other own properties
of that object.

All objects are logically collections of properties, but there are
multiple forms of objects that differ in their semantics for accessing
and manipulating their properties. O_rdinary objects_ are the most
common form of objects and have the default object semantics. An _exotic
object_ is any form of object whose property semantics differ in any way
from the default semantics.

Property Attributes

Attributes are used in this specification to define and explain the
state of Object properties. A data property associates a key value with
the attributes listed in Table 2.

Table 2 — Attributes of a Data Property

  _ATTRIBUTE NAME_   _VALUE DOMAIN_                 DESCRIPTION
  ------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[Value]]          Any ECMAScript language type   The value retrieved by a get access of the property.
  [[Writable]]       Boolean                        If FALSE, attempts by ECMAScript code to change the property’s [[Value]] attribute using [[Set]] will not succeed.
  [[Enumerable]]     Boolean                        If TRUE, the property will be enumerated by a for-in enumeration (see 13.6.3.6). Otherwise, the property is said to be non-enumerable.
  [[Configurable]]   Boolean                        If FALSE, attempts to delete the property, change the property to be an accessor property, or change its attributes (other than [[Value]], or changing [[Writable]] to FALSE) will fail.

An accessor property associates a key value with the attributes listed
in Table 3.

Table 3 — Attributes of an Accessor Property

  _ATTRIBUTE NAME_   _VALUE DOMAIN_          DESCRIPTION
  ------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[Get]]            Object or Undefined   If the value is an Object it must be a function Object. The function’s [[Call]] internal method (Table 6) is called with an empty arguments list to retrieve the property value each time a get access of the property is performed.
  [[Set]]            Object or Undefined   If the value is an Object it must be a function Object. The function’s [[Call]] internal method (Table 6) is called with an arguments list containing the assigned value as its sole argument each time a set access of the property is performed. The effect of a property's [[Set]] internal method may, but is not required to, have an effect on the value returned by subsequent calls to the property's [[Get]] internal method.
  [[Enumerable]]     Boolean                 If TRUE, the property is to be enumerated by a for-in enumeration (see 13.6.3.6). Otherwise, the property is said to be non-enumerable.
  [[Configurable]]   Boolean                 If FALSE, attempts to delete the property, change the property to be a data property, or change its attributes will fail.

If the initial values of a property’s attributes are not explicitly
specified by this specification, the default value defined in Table 4 is
used.

Table 4 — Default Attribute Values

  ATTRIBUTE NAME     DEFAULT VALUE
  ------------------ ---------------
  [[Value]]          UNDEFINED
  [[Get]]            UNDEFINED
  [[Set]]            UNDEFINED
  [[Writable]]       FALSE
  [[Enumerable]]     FALSE
  [[Configurable]]   FALSE

Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots

The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via
algorithms called _internal methods_. Each object in an ECMAScript
engine is associated with a set of internal methods that defines its
runtime behaviour. These internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript
language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository
purposes. However, each object within an implementation of ECMAScript
must behave as specified by the internal methods associated with it. The
exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the
implementation.

Internal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object
values may perform different algorithms when a common internal method
name is invoked upon them. If, at runtime, the implementation of an
algorithm attempts to use an internal method of an object that the
object does not support, a TYPEERROR exception is thrown.

Internal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with
objects and used by various ECMAScript specification algorithms.
Internal slots are not object properties and they are not inherited.
Depending upon the specific internal slot specification, such state may
consist of values of any ECMAScript language type or of specific ECMA
specification type values. Unless explicitly specified otherwise,
internal slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an
object and may not be dynamically added to an object. Unless specified
otherwise, the initial value of an internal slot is the value UNDEFINED.
Various algorithms within this specification create objects that have
internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides no direct way
to associate internal slots with an object.

Internal methods and internal slots are identified within this
specification using names enclosed in double square brackets [[ ]].

Table 5 summarizes the _essential internal methods_ used by this
specification that are applicable to all objects created or manipulated
by ECMAScript code. Every object must have algorithms for all of the
essential internal methods. However, all objects do not necessarily use
the same algorithms for those methods.

The “Signature” column of Table 5 and other similar tables describes the
invocation pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern
always includes a parenthesized list of descriptive parameter names. If
a parameter name is the same as an ECMAScript type name then the name
describes the required type of the parameter value. If an internal
method explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the
symbol “→” and the type name of the returned value. The type names used
in signatures refer to the types defined in clause 6 augmented by the
following additional names. “any” means the value may be any
ECMAScript language type. An internal method implicitly returns a
Completion Record as described in 6.2.2. In addition to its parameters,
an internal method always has access to the object upon which it is
invoked as a method.

  [[GetPrototypeOf]]      ()→Object or Null                               Determine the object that provides inherited properties for this object. A NULL value indicates that there are no inherited properties.

  [[SetPrototypeOf]]      (Object or Null)→Boolean                      Associate with an object another object that provides inherited properties. Passing NULL indicates that there are no inherited properties. Returns TRUE indicating that the operation was completed successfully or FALSE indicating that the operation was not successful.

  [[IsExtensible]]        ( )→Boolean                                     Determine whether it is permitted to add additional properties to an object.

  [[PreventExtensions]]   ( )→Boolean                                     Control whether new properties may be added to an object. Returns TRUE indicating that the operation was completed successfully or FALSE indicating that the operation was not successful.

  [[GetOwnProperty]]      (propertyKey) →                                 Returns a Property Descriptor for the own property of this object whose key is propertyKey, or UNDEFINED if no such property exists.

  [[HasProperty]]         (propertyKey) → Boolean                       Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the object already has either an own or inherited property whose key is propertyKey.

  [[Get]]                 (propertyKey, Receiver) _→ any_               Retrieve the value of an object’s property using the propertyKey parameter. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to retrieve the property value, Receiver is used as the THIS value when evaluating the code.

  [[Set]]                 (propertyKey_,_value, Receiver) _→ Boolean_   Try to set the value of an object’s property indentified by propertyKey to value. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to set the property value, Receiver is used as the THIS value when evaluating the code. Returns TRUE indicating that the property value was set or FALSE indicating that it could not be set.

  [[Delete]]              (propertyKey) → Boolean                       Removes the own property indentified by the propertyKey parameter from the object. Return FALSE if the property was not deleted and is still present. Return TRUE if the property was deleted or was not present.

  [[DefineOwnProperty]]   (_propertyKey, PropertyDescriptor_) → Boolean   Creates or alters the named own property to have the state described by a Property Descriptor. Returns TRUE indicating that the property was successfully created/updated or FALSE indicating that the property could not be created or updated.

  [[Enumerate]]           ()→Object                                       Returns an iterator object over the keys of the string-keyed enumerable properties of the object.

  [[OwnPropertyKeys]]     ()→Array of propertyKey                         Returns an Array object whose elements are all of the own property keys for the object.

Table 6 summarizes additional essential internal methods that are
supported by objects that may be called as functions.

Table 6 — Additional Essential Internal Methods of Function Objects

  _INTERNAL METHOD_   SIGNATURE                          DESCRIPTION

  [[Call]]            (any, a List of any) → any   Executes code associated with the object. Invoked via a function call expression. The arguments to the internal method are a THIS value and a list containing the arguments passed to the function by a call expression. Objects that implement this internal method are callable.
  [[Construct]]       (a List of any) → Object         Creates an object. Invoked via the NEW operator. The arguments to the internal method are the arguments passed to the NEW operator. Objects that implement this internal method are called constructors. A Function object is not necessarily a constructor and such non-constructor Function objects do not have a [[Construct]] internal method.

The semantics of the essential internal method for ordinary objects and
standard exotic objects are specified in clause 8.5.1. If any specified
use of an exotic object's internal methods is not supported by an
implementation, that usage must throw a TYPEERROR exception when
attempted.

Invariants of the Essential Internal Methods

The Internal Methods of Objects of an ECMAScript engine must conform to
the list of invariants specified below. Ordinary ECMAScript Objects as
well as all standard exotic objects in this specification maintain these
invariants. ECMAScript Proxy objects maintain these invariants by means
of runtime checks on the result of traps invoked on the [[ProxyHandler]]
object.

Any implementation provided exotic objects must also maintain these
invariants for those objects. Violation of these invariants may cause
ECMAScript code to have unpredictable behaviour and create security
issues. However, violation of these invariants must never compromise the
memory safety of an implementation.

Definitions:

● The target of an internal method is the object the internal method
is called upon.

● A target is non-extensible if it has been observed to return false
from its [[IsExtensible]] internal method, or true from its
[[PreventExtensions]] internal method.

● A non-existent property is a property that does not exist as an own
property on a non-extensible target.

● All references to SameValue are according to the definition of
SameValue algorithm specified in 7.2.3.

[[GETPROTOTYPEOF]] ( )

● The Type of the return value must be either Object or Null.

● If target is non-extensible, and [[GetPrototypeOf]] returns a value v,
then any future calls to [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return the SameValue
as v.

● An object’s prototype chain must have finite length (that is, starting
from any object, recursively applying the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal
method to its result must eventually lead to the value null.

[[SETPROTOTYPEOF]] (V)

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● If target is non-extensible, [[SetPrototypeOf]] must return false,
unless V is the SameValue as the target’s observed [[GetPrototypeOf]]
value.

[[PREVENTEXTENSIONS]] ( )

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● If [[PreventExtensions]] returns true, all future calls to
[[IsExtensible]] on the target must return false and the target is now
considered non-extensible.

[[GETOWNPROPERTY]] (P)

● The Type of the return value must be either Object or Undefined.

● If the Type of the return value is Object, that object must be a
complete property descriptor (see 6.2.4.6).

● If a property is described as a data property and it may return
different values over time, then either or both of the Desc.[[Writable]]
and Desc.[[Configurable]] attributes must be true even if no mechanism
to change the value is exposed via the other internal methods.

● If a property P is described as a data property with Desc.[[Value]]
equal to v and Desc.[[Writable]] and Desc.[[Configurable]] are both
false, then the SameValue must be returned for the Desc.[[Value]]
attribute of the property on all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] ( P
).

● If P’s attributes other than [[Writable]] may change over time or if
the property might disappear, then P’s [[Configurable]] attribute must
be true.

● If the [[Writable]] attribute may change from false to true, then the
[[Configurable]] attribute must be true.

● If the target is non-extensible and P is non-existent, then all future
calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) on the target must describe P as
non-existent (i.e. [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) must return undefined)

[[DEFINEOWNPROPERTY]] (P, DESC)

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● [[DefineOwnProperty]] must return false if P has previously been
observed as a non-configurable own property of the target, unless
either:

  1. P is a non-configurable writable own data property. A
  non-configurable writable data property can be changed into a
  non-configurable non-writable data property.

2. All attributes in Desc are the SameValue as P’s attributes.

● [[DefineOwnProperty]] (P, Desc) must return false if target is
non-extensible and P is a non-existent own property. That is, a
non-extensible target object cannot be extended with new properties.

[[HASPROPERTY]] ( P )

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● If P was previously observed as a non-configurable data or accessor
own property of the target, [[HasProperty]] must return true.

[[GET]] (P, RECEIVER)

● If P was previously observed as a non-configurable, non-writable own
data property of the target with value v, then [[Get]] must return the
SameValue.

● If P was previously observed as a non-configurable own accessor
property of the target whose [[Get]] attribute is undefined, the [[Get]]
operation must return undefined.

[[SET]] ( P, V, RECEIVER)

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● If P was previously observed as a non-configurable, non-writable own
data property of the target, then [[Set]] must return false unless V is
the SameValue as P’s [[Value]] attribute.

● If P was previously observed as a non-configurable own accessor
property of the target whose [[Set]] attribute is undefined, the [[Set]]
operation must return false.

[[DELETE]] ( P )

● The Type of the return value must be Boolean.

● If P was previously observed to be a non-configurable own data or
accessor property of the target, [[Delete]] must return false.

[[ENUMERATE]] ( )

● The Type of the return value must be Object.

[[OWNPROPERTYKEYS]] ( )

● The Type of the return value must be Object.

● The return value must be an exotic Array object.

● The returned array must contain at least the keys of all
non-configurable own properties that have previously been observed.

● If the object is non-extensible, the returned array must contain only
the keys of all own properties of the object that are observable using
[[GetOwnProperty]].

[[CONSTRUCT]] ( )

● The Type of the return value must be Object.

Well-Known Intrinsic Objects

Well-known intrinsics are built-in objects that are explicitly
referenced by the algorithms of this specification and which usually
have Realm specific identities. Unless otherwise specified each
intrinsic object actually corresponds to a set of similar objects, one
per Realm.

Within this specification a reference such as %name% means the intrinsic
object, associated with the current Realm, corresponding to the name.
Determination of the current Realm and its intrinsics is described in
8.1.2.5. The well-known intrinsics are listed in Table 7.

 ECMAScript Specification Types

A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within
algorithms to describe the semantics of ECMAScript language constructs
and ECMAScript language types. The specification types are Reference,
List, Completion, Property Descriptor, Lexical Environment, Environment
Record, and Data Block. Specification type values are specification
artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity
within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may be
used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression
evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or
values of ECMAScript language variables.

The List and Record Specification Type

The List type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see
12.3.6) in NEW expressions, in function calls, and in other algorithms
where a simple ordered list of values is needed. Values of the List type
are simply ordered sequences of list elements containing the individual
values. These sequences may be of any length. The elements of a list may
be randomly accessed using 0-origin indices. For notational convience an
array-like syntax can be used to access List elements. For example,
arguments[2] is shorthand for saying the 3^rd^ element of the List
arguments.

The Record type is used to describe data aggregations within the
algorithms of this specification. A Record type value consists of one or
more named fields. The value of each field is either an ECMAScript value
or an abstract value represented by a name associated with the Record
type. Field names are always enclosed in double brackets, for example
[[value]]

For notational convenience within this specification, an object
literal-like syntax can be used to express a Record value. For example,
{[[field1]]: 42, [[field2]]: FALSE, [[field3]]: EMPTY} defines a Record
value that has three fields each of which is initialized to a specific
value. Field name order is not significant. Any fields that are not
explicitly listed are considered to be absent.

In specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer
to a specific field of a Record value. For example, if R is the record
shown in the previous paragraph then R.[[field2]] is shorthand for “the
field of R named [[field2]]”.

Schema for commonly used Record field combinations may be named, and
that name may be used as a prefix to a literal Record value to identify
the specific kind of aggregations that is being described. For example:
PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: 42, [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]:
TRUE}.

The Completion Record Specification Type

The Completion type is a Record used to explain the runtime propagation
of values and control flow such as the behaviour of statements (BREAK,
CONTINUE, RETURN and THROW) that perform nonlocal transfers of control.

Values of the Completion type are Record values whole fields are defined
as by Table 8.

Table 8 — Completion Record Fields

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_   VALUE                                            MEANING
  [[type]]       One of NORMAL, BREAK, CONTINUE, RETURN, or THROW   The type of completion that occurred.
  [[value]]      any ECMAScript language value or EMPTY             The value that was produced.
  [[target]]     any ECMAScript string or EMPTY                     The target label for directed control transfers.
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------

The term “abrupt completion” refers to any completion with a [[type]]
value other than NORMAL.

NormalCompletion

The abstract operation NormalCompletion with a single argument, such
as:

1.  Return NormalCompletion(argument).

Is a shorthand that is defined as follows:

1.  Return Completion{[[type]]: normal, [[value]]: argument,
    [[target]]:empty}.

Implicit Completion Values

The algorithms of this specification often implicitly return Completion
Records whose [[type]] is NORMAL. Unless it is otherwise obvious from
the context, an algorithm statement that returns a value that is not a
Completion Record, such as:

1.  Return "Infinity".

Generally means the same thing as:

1.  Return NormalCompletion("INFINITY").

A “return” statement without a value in an algorithm step means the same
thing as:

1.  Return NormalCompletion(UNDEFINED).

Similarly, any reference to a Completion Record value that is in a
context that does not explicitly require a complete Completion Record
value is equivalent to an explicit reference to the [[value]] field of
the Completion Record value unless the Completion Record is an abrupt
completion.

Throw an Exception

Algorithms steps that say to throw an exception, such as

1.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

mean the same things as:

1.  Return Completion{[[type]]: throw, [[value]]: a newly created
    TYPEERROR object, [[target]]:empty}.

ReturnIfAbrupt

Algorithms steps that say

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(argument).

mean the same thing as:

1.  If argument is an abrupt completion, then return argument.

2.  Else if argument is a Completion Record, then let argument be
    argument.[[value]].

The Reference Specification Type

NOTE The Reference type is used to explain the behaviour of such
operators as DELETE, TYPEOF, the assignment operators, the SUPER keyword
and other language features. For example, the left-hand operand of an
assignment is expected to produce a reference.

A REFERENCE is a resolved name or property binding. A Reference consists
of three components, the base value, the _referenced name_ and the
Boolean valued _strict reference_ flag. The base value is either
UNDEFINED, an Object, a Boolean, a String, a Symbol, a Number, or an
environment record (8.1.1). A base value of UNDEFINED indicates that
the Reference could not be resolved to a binding. The _referenced name_
is a String or Symbol value.

A Super Reference is a Reference that is used to represents a name
binding that was expressed using the super keyword. A Super Reference
has an additional thisValue component and its base value will never
be an environment record.

The following abstract operations are used in this specification to
access the components of references:

-   GetBase(V). Returns the base value component of the reference V.

-   GetReferencedName(V). Returns the _referenced name_ component of the
      reference V.

-   IsStrictReference(V). Returns the _strict reference_ flag component
      of the reference V.

-   HasPrimitiveBase(V). Returns TRUE if Type(base) is a Boolean,
      String, Symbol, or Number.

-   IsPropertyReference(V). Returns TRUE if either the base value is
      an object or HasPrimitiveBase(V) is TRUE; otherwise returns FALSE.

-   IsUnresolvableReference(V). Returns TRUE if the base value is
      UNDEFINED and FALSE otherwise.

-   IsSuperReference(V). Returns TRUE if this reference has a
      thisValue component.

The following abstract operations are used in this specification to
operate on references:

GetValue (V)

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(V).

2.  If Type(V) is not Reference, return V.

3.  Let base be GetBase(V).

4.  If IsUnresolvableReference(V), throw a REFERENCEERROR exception.

5.  If IsPropertyReference(V), then

    a.  If HasPrimitiveBase(V) is TRUE, then

        i.  Assert: In this case, base will never be NULL or
            UNDEFINED.

        ii. Let base be ToObject(base).

    b.  Return the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of
        base passing GetReferencedName(V) and GetThisValue(V) as
        the arguments.

6.  Else base must be an environment record,

    a.  Return the result of calling the GetBindingValue (see 8.1.1)
        concrete method of base passing GetReferencedName(V) and
        IsStrictReference(V) as arguments.

NOTE The object that may be created in step 5.a.ii is not accessible
outside of the above abstract operation and the ordinary object [[Get]]
internal method. An implementation might choose to avoid the actual
creation of the object.

PutValue (V, W)

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(V).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(W).

3.  If Type(V) is not Reference, throw a REFERENCEERROR exception.

4.  Let base be GetBase(V).

5.  If IsUnresolvableReference(V), then

    a.  If IsStrictReference(V) is TRUE, then

        i.  Throw REFERENCEERROR exception.

    b.  Let globalObj be the result of the abstract operation
        GetGlobalObject.

    c.  Return Put(globalObj_,GetReferencedName(_V), W, FALSE).

6.  Else if IsPropertyReference(V), then

    a.  If HasPrimitiveBase(V) is TRUE, then

        i.  Assert: In this case, base will never be NULL or
            UNDEFINED.

        ii. Set base to ToObject(base).

    b.  Let succeeded be the result of calling the [[Set]] internal
        method of base passing GetReferencedName(V), W, and
        GetThisValue(V) as arguments.

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(succeeded).

    d.  If succeeded is FALSE and IsStrictReference(V) is TRUE, then
        throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    e.  Return.

7.  Else base must be a Reference whose base is an environment record.

    a.  Return the result of calling the SetMutableBinding (8.1.1)
        concrete method of base, passing GetReferencedName(V), W,
        and IsStrictReference(V) as arguments.

NOTE The object that may be created in step 6.a.ii is not accessible
outside of the above algorithm and the ordinary object [[Set]] internal
method. An implementation might choose to avoid the actual creation of
that object.

GetThisValue (V)

1.  Assert: IsPropertyReference(V) is TRUE.

2.  If IsSuperReference(V), then

    a.  Return the value of the thisValue component of the reference
        V.

3.  Return GetBase(V).

The Property Descriptor Specification Type

The Property Descriptor type is used to explain the manipulation and
reification of Object property attributes. Values of the Property
Descriptor type are Records. Each field’s name is an attribute name and
its value is a corresponding attribute value as specified in 6.1.7.1. In
addition, any field may be present or absent. The schema name used
within this specification to tag literal descriptions of Property
Descriptor records is “PropertyDescriptor”.

Property Descriptor values may be further classified as data Property
Descriptors and accessor Property Descriptors based upon the existence
or use of certain fields. A data Property Descriptor is one that
includes any fields named either [[Value]] or [[Writable]]. An accessor
Property Descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Get]]
or [[Set]]. Any Property Descriptor may have fields named [[Enumerable]]
and [[Configurable]]. A Property Descriptor value may not be both a data
Property Descriptor and an accessor Property Descriptor; however, it may
be neither. A generic Property Descriptor is a Property Descriptor value
that is neither a data Property Descriptor nor an accessor Property
Descriptor. A fully populated Property Descriptor is one that is either
an accessor Property Descriptor or a data Property Descriptor and that
has all of the fields that correspond to the property attributes defined
in either Table 2 or Table 3.

The following abstract operations are used in this specification to
operate upon Property Descriptor values:

IsAccessorDescriptor ( Desc )

When the abstract operation IsAccessorDescriptor is called with Property
Descriptor Desc, the following steps are taken:

1.  If Desc is UNDEFINED, then return FALSE.

2.  If both Desc.[[Get]] and Desc.[[Set]] are absent, then return
    FALSE.

3.  Return TRUE.

IsDataDescriptor ( Desc )

When the abstract operation IsDataDescriptor is called with Property
Descriptor Desc, the following steps are taken:

1.  If Desc is UNDEFINED, then return FALSE.

2.  If both Desc.[[Value]] and Desc.[[Writable]] are absent, then
    return FALSE.

The Lexical Environment and Environment Record Specification Types

The Lexical Environment and Environment Record types are used to explain
the behaviour of name resolution in nested functions and blocks. These
types and the operations upon them are defined in 8.1.

Data Blocks

The Data Block specification type is used to describe a distinct and
mutable sequence of byte-sized (8 bit) numeric values. A Data Block
value is created with a fixed number of bytes that each have the initial
value 0.

For notational convenience within this specification, an array-like
syntax can be used to express to the individual bytes of a Data Block
value. This notation presents a Data Block value as a 0-origined integer
indexed sequence of bytes. For example, if db is a 5 byte Data Block
value then db[2] can be used to express access to its 3^rd^ byte.

The following abstract operations are used in this specification to
operate upon Data Block values:

CreateByteDataBlock(size)

When the abstract operation CreateByteDataBlock is called with integer
argument size, the following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: size≥0.

2.  Let db be a new Data Block value consisting of size bytes. If it
    is impossible to create such a Data Block, then throw a RANGEERROR
    exception.

3.  Set all of the bytes of db to 0.

4.  Return db.

CopyDataBlockBytes(toBlock, toIndex, fromBlock, fromIndex, count)

When the abstract operation CopyDataBlockBytes is called the following
steps are taken:

1.  Assert: fromBlock and toBlock are distinct Data Block values.

2.  Assert: fromIndex, toIndex, and count are positive integer
    values.

3.  Let fromSize be the number of bytes in fromBlock.

4.  Assert: fromIndex_+_count ≤ fromSize.

5.  Let toSize be the number of bytes in toBlock.

6.  Assert: toIndex_+_count ≤ toSize.

7.  Repeat, while count>0

    a.  Set toBlock_[_toIndex] to the value of
        fromBlock_[_fromIndex].

    b.  Increment toIndex and fromIndex each by 1.

    c.  Decrement count by 1.

8.  Return NormalCompletion(empty)



ABSTRACT OPERATIONS 


These operations are not a part of the ECMAScript language; they are
defined here to solely to aid the specification of the semantics of the
ECMAScript language. Other, more specialized abstract operations are
defined throughout this specification.


Type Conversion and Testing

The ECMAScript language implicitly performs automatic type conversion as
needed. To clarify the semantics of certain constructs it is useful to
define a set of conversion abstract operations. The conversion abstract
operations are polymorphic; they can accept a value of any ECMAScript
language type or of a Completion Record value. But no other
specification types are used with these operations.

ToPrimitive ( input [, PreferredType] )

The abstract operation ToPrimitive takes an input argument and an
optional argument PreferredType. The abstract operation ToPrimitive
converts its input argument to a non-Object type. If an object is
capable of converting to more than one primitive type, it may use the
optional hint PreferredType to favour that type. Conversion occurs
according to Table 9:

Table 9 — ToPrimitive Conversions

  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _INPUT TYPE_        RESULT
  Completion Record   If input is an abrupt completion, return input. Otherwise return ToPrimitive(input.[[value]]) also passing the optional hint PreferredType.
  Undefined           Return input (no conversion).
  Null                Return input (no conversion).
  Boolean             Return input (no conversion).
  Number              Return input (no conversion).
  String              Return input (no conversion).
  Symbol              Return input (no conversion).
  Object              Perform the steps following this table.
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Type(input) is Object, the following steps are taken:

1.  If PreferredType was not passed, let hint be "DEFAULT".

2.  Else if PreferredType is hint String, let hint be "STRING".

3.  Else PreferredType is hint Number, let hint be "NUMBER".

4.  Let exoticToPrim be GetMethod(input, @@toPrimitive).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(exoticToPrim).

6.  If exoticToPrim is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let result be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of exoticToPrim, with input as thisArgument and
        (hint) as argumentsList.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(result).

    c.  If Type(result) is not Object, then return result.

    d.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If hint is "DEFAULT" then, let hint be "NUMBER".

8.  Return OrdinaryToPrimitive(input,hint).

When the abstract operation OrdinaryToPrimitive is called with arguments
O and hint, the following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: Type(O) is Object

2.  Assert: Type(hint) is String and its value is either "STRING" or
    "NUMBER".

3.  If hint is "STRING", then

    a.  Let methodNames be the List ( "TOSTRING", "VALUEOF").

4.  Else,

    a.  Let methodNames be the List ( "VALUEOF", "TOSTRING").

5.  For each name in methodNames in List order, do

    a.  Let method be Get(O, name).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(method).

    c.  If IsCallable(method) is TRUE then,

        i.  Let result be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
            method of method, with O as thisArgument and an empty
            List as argumentsList.

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(result).

        iii. If Type(result) is not Object, then return result.

6.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

NOTE When ToPrimitive is called with no hint, then it generally behaves
as if the hint were Number. However, objects may over-ride this
behaviour by defining a @@toPrimitive method. Of the objects defined in
this specification only Date objects (see 20.3) and Symbol objects (see
19.4.3.4) over-ride the default ToPrimitive behaviour. Date objects
treat no hint as if the hint were String.

ToBoolean ( argument )

The abstract operation ToBoolean converts argument to a value of type
Boolean according to Table 10:

Table 10 — ToBoolean Conversions

  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _ARGUMENT TYPE_     RESULT
  Completion Record   If argument is an abrupt completion, return argument. Otherwise return ToBoolean(argument.[[value]])
  Undefined           Return FALSE
  Null                Return FALSE
  Boolean             Return argument (no conversion).
  Number              Return FALSE if argument is +0, −0, or NAN; otherwise return TRUE.
  String              Return FALSE if argument is the empty String (its length is zero); otherwise return TRUE.
  Symbol              Return TRUE
  Object              Return TRUE
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToNumber ( argument )

The abstract operation ToNumber converts argument to a value of type
Number according to Table 11:

Table 11 — ToNumber Conversions

  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _ARGUMENT TYPE_     RESULT

  Completion Record   If argument is an abrupt completion, return argument. Otherwise return ToNumber(argument.[[value]])

  Undefined           Return NAN

  Null                Return +0

  Boolean             Return 1 if argument is TRUE. Return +0 if argument is FALSE.

  Number              Return argument (no conversion).

  String              See grammar and conversion algorithm below.

  Symbol              Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

  Object              Apply the following steps:
                      
                      Let primValue be ToPrimitive(argument, hint Number).
                      
                      Return ToNumber(primValue).
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToNumber Applied to the String Type

ToNumber applied to Strings applies the following grammar to the input
String interpreted as a sequence of UTF-16 encoded code points. If the
grammar cannot interpret the String as an expansion of
StringNumericLiteral, then the result of ToNumber is NAN.

NOTE The terminal symbols of this grammar are all composed of Unicode
BMP code points so the result will be NAN if the string contains the
UTF-16 encoding of any supplementary code points or any unpaired
surrogate code points

NOTE Some differences should be noted between the syntax of a
StringNumericLiteral and a NumericLiteral (see 11.8.3):

-   A StringNumericLiteral may include leading and/or trailing white
    space and/or line terminators.

-   A StringNumericLiteral that is decimal may have any number of
    leading 0 digits.

-   A StringNumericLiteral that is decimal may include a + or - to
    indicate its sign.

-   A StringNumericLiteral that is empty or contains only white space
    is converted to +0.

-   INFINITY AND –INFINITY are recognized as a StringNumericLiteral
    but not as a NumericLiteral.

Runtime Semantics: MV’s

The conversion of a String to a Number value is similar overall to the
determination of the Number value for a numeric literal (see 11.8.3),
but some of the details are different, so the process for converting a
String numeric literal to a value of Number type is given here in full.
This value is determined in two steps: first, a mathematical value (MV)
is derived from the String numeric literal; second, this mathematical
value is rounded as described below.

-   The MV of StringNumericLiteral ::: [empty] is 0.

-   The MV of StringNumericLiteral ::: StrWhiteSpace is 0.

-   The MV of StringNumericLiteral ::: StrWhiteSpace~opt~
      StrNumericLiteral StrWhiteSpace~opt~ is the MV of
      StrNumericLiteral, no matter whether white space is present or
      not.

      StrDecimalLiteral.

      the MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral.

-   The MV of StrDecimalLiteral ::: - StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral is
      the negative of the MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral. (Note that
      if the MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral is 0, the negative of
      this MV is also 0. The rounding rule described below handles the
      conversion of this signless mathematical zero to a floating-point
      +0 or −0 as appropriate.)

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: INFINITY is 10^10000^ (a
      value so large that it will round to +∞).

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits. is the MV
      of DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits .
      DecimalDigits is the MV of the first DecimalDigits plus (the
      MV of the second DecimalDigits times 10^−n^), where n is the
      number of code points in the second DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits.
      ExponentPart is the MV of DecimalDigits times 10^e^, where
      e is the MV of ExponentPart.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits.
      _DecimalDigits ExponentPart_ is (the MV of the first
      DecimalDigits plus (the MV of the second DecimalDigits times
      10^−n^)) times 10^e^, where n is the number of code points
      in the second DecimalDigits and e is the MV of ExponentPart.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral:::. DecimalDigits is the MV
      of DecimalDigits times 10^−n^, where n is the number of code
      points in DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral:::. _DecimalDigits

      where n is the number of code points in DecimalDigits and e
      is the MV of ExponentPart.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits is the MV
      of DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral::: DecimalDigits
      ExponentPart is the MV of DecimalDigits times 10^e^, where
      e is the MV of ExponentPart.

-   The MV of DecimalDigits ::: DecimalDigit is the MV of
      DecimalDigit.

-   The MV of DecimalDigits ::: DecimalDigits DecimalDigit is (the
      MV of DecimalDigits times 10) plus the MV of DecimalDigit.

-   The MV of ExponentPart ::: _ExponentIndicator SignedInteger_ is
      the MV of SignedInteger.

-   The MV of SignedInteger ::: DecimalDigits is the MV of
      DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of SignedInteger ::: + DecimalDigits is the MV of
      DecimalDigits.

      the MV of DecimalDigits.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 0 or of HexDigit ::: 0 is 0.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 1 or of HexDigit ::: 1 is 1.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 2 or of HexDigit ::: 2 is 2.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 3 or of HexDigit ::: 3 is 3.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 4 or of HexDigit ::: 4 is 4.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 5 or of HexDigit ::: 5 is 5.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 6 or of HexDigit ::: 6 is 6.

-   The MV of DecimalDigit ::: 7 or of HexDigit ::: 7 is 7.

-   The MV of HexDigit ::: B or of HexDigit ::: B is 11.

-   The MV of HexDigit ::: C or of HexDigit ::: C is 12.

-   The MV of HexDigit ::: D or of HexDigit ::: D is 13.

-   The MV of HexDigit ::: E or of HexDigit ::: E is 14.

      HexDigit.

-   The MV of HexIntegerLiteral ::: HexIntegerLiteral HexDigit is
      (the MV of HexIntegerLiteral times 16) plus the MV of
      HexDigit.

Once the exact MV for a String numeric literal has been determined, it
is then rounded to a value of the Number type. If the MV is 0, then the
rounded value is +0 unless the first non white space code point in the
String numeric literal is ‘-’, in which case the rounded value is −0.
Otherwise, the rounded value must be the Number value for the MV (in the
sense defined in 6.1.6), unless the literal includes a
StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral and the literal has more than 20 significant
digits, in which case the Number value may be either the Number value
for the MV of a literal produced by replacing each significant digit
after the 20th with a 0 digit or the Number value for the MV of a
literal produced by replacing each significant digit after the 20th with
a 0 digit and then incrementing the literal at the 20th digit position.
A digit is significant if it is not part of an ExponentPart and

-   it is not 0; or

-   there is a nonzero digit to its left and there is a nonzero digit,
    not in the ExponentPart, to its right.

4.  Let int be sign(number) × floor(abs(number)).

5.  Let int8bit be int modulo 2^8^.

6.  If int8bit ≥ 2^7^, return int8bit − 2^8^, otherwise return
    int8bit.

ToUint8 ( argument ) — Unsigned 8 Bit Integer

The abstract operation ToUint8 converts argument to one of 2^8^
integer values in the range 0 through 255, inclusive. This abstract
operation functions as follows:

1.  Let number be ToNumber(argument).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(number).

3.  If number is NAN, +0, −0, +∞, or −∞, return +0.

4.  Let int be sign(number) × floor(abs(number)).

5.  Let int8bit be int modulo 2^8^.

6.  Return int8bit.

ToUint8Clamp ( argument ) — Unsigned 8 Bit Integer, Clamped

The abstract operation ToUint8Clamp converts argument to one of 2^8^
integer values in the range 0 through 255, inclusive. This abstract
operation functions as follows:

1.  Let number be ToNumber(argument).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(number).

3.  If number is NAN, return +0.

8.  If number < _f +_ 0.5, then return f.

9.  If f is odd, then return f + 1.

10. Return f.

NOTE Note that unlike the other ECMAScript integer conversion abstract
operation, ToUint8Clamp rounds rather than truncates non-integer values
and does not convert +∞ to 0. ToUint8Clamp does “round half to even”
tie-breaking. This differs from MATH.ROUND which does “round half up”
tie-breaking.

ToString ( argument )

The abstract operation ToString converts argument to a value of type
String according to Table 12:

Table 12 — ToString Conversions

  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Completion Record   If argument is an abrupt completion, return argument. Otherwise return ToString(argument.[[value]])

  Undefined           "UNDEFINED"

  Null                "NULL"

  Boolean             If argument is TRUE, then return "TRUE".
                      
                      If argument is FALSE, then return "FALSE".

  Number              See 7.1.12.1.

  String              Return argument (no conversion)

  Symbol              Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

  Object              Apply the following steps:
                      
                      1. Let primValue be ToPrimitive(argument, hint String).
                      
                      2. Return ToString(primValue).
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToString Applied to the Number Type

The abstract operation ToString converts a Number m to String format
as follows:

1.  If m is NAN, return the String "NAN".

2.  If m is +0 or −0, return the String "0".

3.  If m is less than zero, return the String concatenation of the
    String "-" and ToString(−m).

4.  If m is +∞, return the String "INFINITY".

5.  Otherwise, let n, k, and s be integers such that k ≥ 1,
    10^k−1^ ≤ s < 10^k^, the Number value for s × 10^n−k^ is
    m, and k is as small as possible. Note that k is the number of
    digits in the decimal representation of s, that s is not
    divisible by 10, and that the least significant digit of s is not
    necessarily uniquely determined by these criteria.

6.  If k ≤ n ≤ 21, return the String consisting of the code points
    of the k digits of the decimal representation of s (in order,
    with no leading zeroes), followed by n−k occurrences of the code
    point U+0030 (DIGIT ZERO).

7.  If 0 < n ≤ 21, return the String consisting of code points of the
    the most significant n digits of the decimal representation of
    s, followed by the code point U+002E (FULL STOP), followed by the
    code points of the remaining k−n digits of the decimal
    representation of s.

8.  If −6 < n ≤ 0, return the String consisting of the code point
    U+0030 (DIGIT ZERO), followed by a the code point U+002E (FULL
    STOP), followed by −n occurrences of the code point U+0030 (DIGIT
    ZERO), followed by the code points of the k digits of the decimal
    representation of s.

9.  Otherwise, if k = 1, return the String consisting of the code
    point of the single digit of s, followed by code point U+0065
    (LATIN SMALL LETTER E), followed by the code point U+002B (PLUS
    SIGN) or the code point U+002D (HYPHEN-MINUS) according to whether
    n−1 is positive or negative, followed by the code points of the
    decimal representation of the integer abs(n−1) (with no leading
    zeroes).

10. Return the String consisting of the code point of the most
    significant digit of the decimal representation of s, followed by
    code point U+002E (FULL STOP), followed by the code points of the
    remaining k−1 digits of the decimal representation of s,
    followed by code point U+0065 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E), followed by
    code point U+002B (PLUS SIGN) or the code point U+002D
    (HYPHEN-MINUS) according to whether n−1 is positive or negative,
    followed by the code points of the decimal representation of the
    integer abs(n−1) (with no leading zeroes).

NOTE 1 The following observations may be useful as guidelines for
implementations, but are not part of the normative requirements of this
Standard:

-   If x is any Number value other than −0, then ToNumber(ToString(x))
    is exactly the same Number value as x.

-   The least significant digit of s is not always uniquely determined
    by the requirements listed in step 5.

NOTE 2 For implementations that provide more accurate conversions than
required by the rules above, it is recommended that the following
alternative version of step 5 be used as a guideline:

  Otherwise, let n, k, and s be integers such that k ≥ 1,
  10^k−1^ ≤ s < 10^k^, the Number value for s × 10^n_−_k^ is
  m, and k is as small as possible. If there are multiple
  possibilities for s, choose the value of s for which s ×
  10^n_−_k^ is closest in value to m. If there are two such possible
  values of s, choose the one that is even. Note that k is the
  number of digits in the decimal representation of s and that s is
  not divisible by 10.

written by David M. Gay for binary-to-decimal conversion of
floating-point numbers:

    UNDEFINED.

Abstract Relational Comparison 

The comparison x < y, where x and y are values, produces TRUE,
FALSE, or UNDEFINED (which indicates that at least one operand is NAN).
In addition to x and y the algorithm takes a Boolean flag named
LeftFirst as a parameter. The flag is used to control the order in
which operations with potentially visible side-effects are performed
upon x and y. It is necessary because ECMAScript specifies left to
right evaluation of expressions. The default value of LeftFirst is
TRUE and indicates that the x parameter corresponds to an expression
that occurs to the left of the y parameter’s corresponding expression.
If LeftFirst is FALSE, the reverse is the case and operations must be
performed upon y before x. Such a comparison is performed as
follows:

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(y).

3.  If the LeftFirst flag is TRUE, then

    a.  Let px be ToPrimitive(x, hint Number).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(px).

    c.  Let py be ToPrimitive(y, hint Number).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(py).

4.  Else the order of evaluation needs to be reversed to preserve left
    to right evaluation

    a.  Let py be ToPrimitive(y, hint Number).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(py).

    c.  Let px be ToPrimitive(x, hint Number).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(px).

5.  If both px and py are Strings, then

    a.  If py is a prefix of px, return FALSE. (A String value p
        is a prefix of String value q if q can be the result of
        concatenating p and some other String r. Note that any
        String is a prefix of itself, because r may be the empty
        String.)

    b.  If px is a prefix of py, return TRUE.

    c.  Let k be the smallest nonnegative integer such that the code
        unit at position k within px is different from the code unit
        at position k within py. (There must be such a k, for
        neither String is a prefix of the other.)

    d.  Let m be the integer that is the code unit value at position
        k within px.

    e.  Let n be the integer that is the code unit value at position
        k within py.

    f.  If m < n, return TRUE. Otherwise, return FALSE.

6.  Else,

    a.  Let nx be ToNumber(px). Because px and py are primitive
        values evaluation order is not important.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nx).

    c.  Let ny be ToNumber(py).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(ny).

    e.  If nx is NAN, return UNDEFINED.

    f.  If ny is NAN, return UNDEFINED.

    g.  If nx and ny are the same Number value, return FALSE.

    h.  If nx is +0 and ny is −0, return FALSE.

    i.  If nx is −0 and ny is +0, return FALSE.

    j.  If nx is +∞, return FALSE.

    k.  If ny is +∞, return TRUE.

    l.  If ny is −∞, return FALSE.

    m.  If nx is −∞, return TRUE.

    n.  If the mathematical value of nx is less than the mathematical
        value of ny —note that these mathematical values are both
        finite and not both zero—return TRUE. Otherwise, return FALSE.

NOTE 1 Step 5 differs from step 11 in the algorithm for the addition
operator + (12.7.3) in using “and” instead of “or”.

NOTE 2 The comparison of Strings uses a simple lexicographic ordering on
sequences of code unit values. There is no attempt to use the more
complex, semantically oriented definitions of character or string
equality and collating order defined in the Unicode specification.
Therefore String values that are canonically equal according to the
Unicode standard could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes
that both Strings are already in normalized form. Also, note that for
strings containing supplementary characters, lexicographic ordering on
sequences of UTF-16 code unit values differs from that on sequences of
code point values.

Abstract Equality Comparison 

The comparison x == y, where x and y are values, produces TRUE
or FALSE. Such a comparison is performed as follows:

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(y).

3.  If Type(x) is the same as Type(y), then

    a.  Return the result of performing Strict Equality Comparison x
        === y.

4.  If x is NULL and y is UNDEFINED, return TRUE.

5.  If x is UNDEFINED and y is NULL, return TRUE.

6.  If Type(x) is Number and Type(y) is String,
    return the result of the comparison x == ToNumber(y).

7.  If Type(x) is String and Type(y) is Number,
    return the result of the comparison ToNumber(x) == y.

8.  If Type(x) is Symbol or Type(y) is Symbol, return FALSE.

9.  If Type(x) is Boolean, return the result of the comparison
    ToNumber(x) == y.

10. If Type(y) is Boolean, return the result of the comparison x ==
    ToNumber(y).

11. If Type(x) is either String or Number and Type(y) is Object,
    return the result of the comparison x == ToPrimitive(y).

12. If Type(x) is Object and Type(y) is either String or Number,
    return the result of the comparison ToPrimitive(x) == y.

13. Return FALSE.

Strict Equality Comparison 

The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces TRUE
or FALSE. Such a comparison is performed as follows:

1.  If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return FALSE.

2.  If Type(x) is Undefined, return TRUE.

3.  If Type(x) is Null, return TRUE.

4.  If Type(x) is Number, then

    a.  If x is NAN, return FALSE.

    b.  If y is NAN, return FALSE.

    c.  If x is the same Number value as y, return TRUE.

    d.  If x is +0 and y is −0, return TRUE.

    e.  If x is −0 and y is +0, return TRUE.

    f.  Return FALSE.

5.  If Type(x) is String, then

    a.  If x and y are exactly the same sequence of code units (same
        length and same code units in corresponding positions), return
        TRUE.

    b.  Else, return FALSE.

6.  If Type(x) is Boolean, then

    a.  If x and y are both TRUE or both FALSE, return TRUE.

    b.  Else, return FALSE.

7.  If x and y are the same Symbol value, return TRUE.

8.  If x and y are the same Object value, return TRUE.

9.  Return FALSE.

NOTE This algorithm differs from the SameValue Algorithm (7.2.3) in its
treatment of signed zeroes and NaNs.


 Operations on Objects

Get (O, P)

The abstract operation Get is used to retrieve the value of a specific
property of an object. The operation is called with arguments O and

NOTE This abstract operation creates a property whose attributes are set
to the same defaults used for properties created by the ECMAScript
language assignment operator. Normally, the property will not already
exist. If it does exist and is not configurable or O is not extensible
[[DefineOwnProperty]] will return FALSE.

Property Descriptor for the property. This abstract operation performs
the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(O) is Object.

    internal method of O passing P and desc as arguments.

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(success).

5.  If success is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  Return success.

Operations on Promise Objects

Promise Objects (25.4) serve as a placeholder for the eventual result of
a deferred (and possibly asynchronous) computation.

Within this specification the adjective “eventual” mean a value or a
Promise object that will ultimately resolves to the value. For example,
“Returns an eventual String” is equivalent to “Returns either a String
or a Promise object that will eventually resolves to a String”. A
“resolved value” is the final value of an “eventual value”.

NOTE The Promise related abstract operations defined in this subclause
are used by specification algorithms when they perform or respond to
asynchronous operations. They ensure that the actual built-in Promise
operations are used by the algorithms, even if ECMAScript code has
modified the properties of %Promise% or %PromisePrototype%.

PromiseNew ( executor ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation PromiseNew allocates and initializes a new
promise object for use by specification algorithm. The executor
argument initiates the deferred computation.

1.  Let promise be AllocatePromise(%Promise%).

2.  Return InitializePromise(promise, executor).

PromiseBuiltinCapability () Abstract Operation

PromiseCapability record (25.4.1.1) for a builtin promise object for
use by specification algorithm.

1.  Let promise be AllocatePromise(%Promise%).

2.  Return CreatePromiseCapabilityRecord(promise, %Promise%).

NOTE This abstract operation is the same as the default built-in
behaviour of NewPromiseCapability abstract operation (25.4.1.4).

PromiseOf (value) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation PromiseOf returns a new Promise that resolves to
the argument value.

1.  Assert: IsPromise(value) is FALSE.

2.  Let capability be PromiseBuiltinCapability( ).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(capability).

4.  Let resolveResult be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
    method of capability.[[Resolve]] with UNDEFINED as thisArgument
    and (value) as argumentsList.

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(resolveResult).

6.  Return capability.[[Promise]].

NOTE This abstract operation is the same as the default built-in
behaviour of the Promise.resolve method (25.4.4.5). However, PromiseOf
does not accept a Promise is its argument.

PromiseAll (promiseList) Abstract Operation

PromiseCatch (promise, rejectedAction) Abstract Operation

PromiseThen (promise, resolvedAction, rejectedAction) Abstract Operation



EXECUTABLE CODE AND EXECUTION CONTEXTS


Lexical Environments

A _Lexical Environment_ is a specification type used to define the
association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based
upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical
Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null
reference to an outer Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical
Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of
ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or
a Catch clause of a TryStatement and a new Lexical Environment is
created each time such code is evaluated.

An _Environment Record_ records the identifier bindings that are created
within the scope of its associated Lexical Environment.

The outer environment reference is used to model the logical nesting of
Lexical Environment values. The outer reference of a (inner) Lexical
Environment is a reference to the Lexical Environment that logically
surrounds the inner Lexical Environment. An outer Lexical Environment
may, of course, have its own outer Lexical Environment. A Lexical
Environment may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner
Lexical Environments. For example, if a FunctionDeclaration contains
two nested FunctionDeclarations then the Lexical Environments of each
of the nested functions will have as their outer Lexical Environment the
Lexical Environment of the current evaluation of the surrounding
function.

A _global environment_ is a Lexical Environment which does not have an
outer environment. The global environment’s outer environment reference
is NULL. A global environment’s environment record may be prepopulated
with identifier bindings and includes an associated _global object_
whose properties provide some of the global environment’s identifier
bindings. This global object is the value of a global environment’s THIS
binding. As ECMAScript code is executed, additional properties may be
added to the global object and the initial properties may be modified.

A method environment is a Lexical Environment that corresponds to the
invocation of an ECMAScript function object that establishes a new THIS
binding. A method environment also captures the state necessary to
support SUPER method invocations.

Lexical Environments and Environment Record values are purely
specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any specific
artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an
ECMAScript program to directly access or manipulate such values.

Environment Records

There are two primary kinds of Environment Record values used in this
specification: _declarative environment records_ and _object environment
records_. Declarative environment records are used to define the effect
of ECMAScript language syntactic elements such as
FunctionDeclarations, VariableDeclarations, and Catch clauses that
directly associate identifier bindings with ECMAScript language values.
Object environment records are used to define the effect of ECMAScript
elements such as WithStatement that associate identifier bindings with
the properties of some object. Global Environment Records and Function
Environment Records are specializations that are used for specifically
for Script global declarations and for top-level declarations within
functions.

For specification purposes Environment Record values can be thought of
as existing in a simple object-oriented hierarchy where Environment
Record is an abstract class with three concrete subclasses, declarative
environment record, object environment record, and global environment
record. Function environment records are a subclass of declarative
environment record. The abstract class includes the abstract
specification methods defined in Table 16. These abstract methods have
distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.

Table 16 — Abstract Methods of Environment Records

  METHOD                     PURPOSE
  ---------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HasBinding(N)                Determine if an environment record has a binding for an identifier. Return TRUE if it does and FALSE if it does not. The String value N is the text of the identifier.
  CreateMutableBinding(N, D)   Create a new but uninitialized mutable binding in an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name. If the optional Boolean argument D is TRUE the binding is may be subsequently deleted.
  CreateImmutableBinding(N)    Create a new but uninitialized immutable binding in an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name.
  InitializeBinding(N,V)       Set the value of an already existing but uninitialized binding in an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name. V is the value for the binding and is a value of any ECMAScript language type.
  SetMutableBinding(N,V, S)    Set the value of an already existing mutable binding in an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name. V is the value for the binding and may be a value of any ECMAScript language type. S is a Boolean flag. If S is TRUE and the binding cannot be set throw a TYPEERROR exception. S is used to identify strict mode references.
  GetBindingValue(N,S)         Returns the value of an already existing binding from an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name. S is used to identify strict mode references. If S is TRUE and the binding does not exist throw a REFERENCEERROR exception. If the binding exists but is uninitialized a REFERENCEERROR is thrown, regardless of the value of S.
  DeleteBinding(N)             Delete a binding from an environment record. The String value N is the text of the bound name If a binding for N exists, remove the binding and return TRUE. If the binding exists but cannot be removed return FALSE. If the binding does not exist return TRUE.
  HasThisBinding()             Determine if an environment record establishes a THIS binding. Return TRUE if it does and FALSE if it does not.
  HasSuperBinding()            Determine if an environment record establishes a SUPER method binding. Return TRUE if it does and FALSE if it does not.
  WithBaseObject ()            If this environment record is associated with a WITH statement, return the with object. Otherwise, return UNDEFINED.

Declarative Environment Records

Each declarative environment record is associated with an ECMAScript
program scope containing variable, constant, let, class, module, import,
and/or function declarations. A declarative environment record binds the
set of identifiers defined by the declarations contained within its
scope.

The behaviour of the concrete specification methods for Declarative
Environment Records is defined by the following algorithms.

HasBinding(N)

The concrete environment record method HasBinding for declarative
environment records simply determines if the argument identifier is one
of the identifiers bound by the record:

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  If envRec has a binding for the name that is the value of N,
    return TRUE.

3.  Return FALSE.

CreateMutableBinding (N, D)

The concrete Environment Record method CreateMutableBinding for
declarative environment records creates a new mutable binding for the
name N that is uninitialized. A binding must not already exist in this
Environment Record for N. If Boolean argument D is provided and has
the value TRUE the new binding is marked as being subject to deletion.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec does not already have a binding for N.

3.  Create a mutable binding in envRec for N and record that it is
    uninitialized. If D is TRUE record that the newly created binding
    may be deleted by a subsequent DeleteBinding call.

4.  Return NormalCompletion(empty).

CreateImmutableBinding (N)

The concrete Environment Record method CreateImmutableBinding for
declarative environment records creates a new immutable binding for the
name N that is uninitialized. A binding must not already exist in this
environment record for N.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec does not already have a binding for N.

3.  Create an immutable binding in envRec for N and record that it
    is uninitialized.

InitializeBinding (N,V)

The concrete Environment Record method InitializeBinding for declarative
environment records is used to set the bound value of the current
binding of the identifier whose name is the value of the argument N to
the value of argument V. An uninitialized binding for N must already
exist.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec must have an uninitialized binding for N.

3.  Set the bound value for N in envRec to V.

4.  Record that the binding for N in envRec has been initialized.

SetMutableBinding (N,V,S)

The concrete Environment Record method SetMutableBinding for declarative
environment records attempts to change the bound value of the current
binding of the identifier whose name is the value of the argument N to
the value of argument V. A binding for N must already exist. If the
binding is an immutable binding, a TYPEERROR is thrown if S is TRUE.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec must have a binding for N.

3.  If the binding for N in envRec has not yet been initialized
    throw a REFERENCEERROR exception.

4.  Else if the binding for N in envRec is a mutable binding, change
    its bound value to V.

5.  Else this must be an attempt to change the value of an immutable
    binding so if S is TRUE throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  Return NormalCompletion(empty).

GetBindingValue(N,S)

The concrete Environment Record method GetBindingValue for declarative
environment records simply returns the value of its bound identifier
whose name is the value of the argument N. If the binding exists but
is uninitialized a REFERENCEERROR is thrown, regardless of the value of
S.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec has a binding for N.

3.  a.  

4.  If the binding for N in envRec is an uninitialized binding, then

5.  throw a REFERENCEERROR exception.

6.  7.  Return the value currently bound to N in envRec.

DeleteBinding (N)

The concrete Environment Record method DeleteBinding for declarative
environment records can only delete bindings that have been explicitly
designated as being subject to deletion.

1.  Let envRec be the declarative environment record for which the
    method was invoked.

2.  If envRec does not have a binding for the name that is the value
    of N, return TRUE.

3.  If the binding for N in envRec cannot be deleted, return FALSE.

4.  Remove the binding for N from envRec.

5.  Return TRUE.

HasThisBinding () 

Regular Declarative Environment Records do not provide a THIS binding.

1.  Return FALSE.

HasSuperBinding ()

Regular Declarative Environment Records do not provide a SUPER binding.

1.  Return FALSE.

 WithBaseObject()

Declarative Environment Records always return UNDEFINED as their
WithBaseObject.

1.  Return UNDEFINED.

Object Environment Records

Each object environment record is associated with an object called its
_binding object_. An object environment record binds the set of string
identifier names that directly correspond to the property names of its
binding object. Property keys that are not strings in the form of an
IdentifierName are not included in the set of bound identifiers. Both
own and inherited properties are included in the set regardless of the
setting of their [[Enumerable]] attribute. Because properties can be
dynamically added and deleted from objects, the set of identifiers bound
by an object environment record may potentially change as a side-effect
of any operation that adds or deletes properties. Any bindings that are
created as a result of such a side-effect are considered to be a mutable
binding even if the Writable attribute of the corresponding property has
the value FALSE. Immutable bindings do not exist for object environment
records.

Object environment records also have a possibly empty List of strings
called unscopables. The strings in this List are excluded from the
environment records set of bound names, regardless of whether or not
they exist as property keys of its binding object.

Object environment records created for WITH statements (13.10) can
provide their binding object as an implicit this value for use in
function calls. The capability is controlled by a withEnvironment
Boolean value that is associated with each object environment record. By
default, the value of withEnvironment is FALSE for any object
environment record.

The behaviour of the concrete specification methods for Object
Environment Records is defined by the following algorithms.

HasBinding(N)

The concrete Environment Record method HasBinding for object environment
records determines if its associated binding object has a property whose
name is the value of the argument N:

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  3.  Let bindings be the binding object for envRec.

4.  Repeat, while bindings is not NULL,

    a.  Let hasOwn be HasOwnProperty(bindings, N).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(hasOwn).

    c.  If hasOwn is TRUE, then

        i.  Let hasUnscopables be HasOwnProperty(bindings,
            @@unscopables).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(hasUnscopables).

        iii. If hasUnscopables is FALSE, then return TRUE.

        iv. Let unscopables be Get(bindings, @@unscopables).

        v.  ReturnIfAbrupt(unscopables).

        vi. If Type(unscopables) is not Object, then return TRUE.

        vii. Let isBlocked be HasOwnProperty(unscopables, N).

        viii. ReturnIfAbrupt(isBlocked).

        ix. If isBlocked is FALSE, then return TRUE.

    d.  Let bindings be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
        internal method of bindings with no arguments.

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(bindings).

5.  Return FALSE.

CreateMutableBinding (N, D)

The concrete Environment Record method CreateMutableBinding for object
environment records creates in an environment record’s associated
binding object a property whose name is the String value and initializes
it to the value UNDEFINED. If Boolean argument D is provided and has
the value TRUE the new property’s [[Configurable]] attribute is set to
TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  Let bindings be the binding object for envRec.

3.  If D is TRUE then let configValue be TRUE otherwise let
    configValue be FALSE.

4.  Return DefinePropertyOrThrow(bindings, N,
    PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]:UNDEFINED, [[Writable]]: TRUE,
    [[Enumerable]]: TRUE , [[Configurable]]: configValue}).

NOTE Normally envRec will not have a binding for N but if it does,
the semantics of DefinePropertyOrThrow may result in an existing binding
being replaced or shadowed or cause an abrupt completion to be returned.

CreateImmutableBinding (N)

The concrete Environment Record method CreateImmutableBinding is never
used within this specification in association with Object environment
records.

InitializeBinding (N,V)

The concrete Environment Record method InitializeBinding for object
environment records is used to set the bound value of the current
binding of the identifier whose name is the value of the argument N to
the value of argument V. An uninitialized binding for N must already
exist.

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  Assert: envRec must have an uninitialized binding for N.

3.  Record that the binding for N in envRec has been initialized.

4.  Return the result of calling the SetMutableBinding concrete method
    of envRec with N, V, and FALSE as arguments.

SetMutableBinding (N,V,S)

The concrete Environment Record method SetMutableBinding for object
environment records attempts to set the value of the environment
record’s associated binding object’s property whose name is the value of
the argument N to the value of argument V. A property named N
normally already exists but if it does not or is not currently writable,
error handling is determined by the value of the Boolean argument S.

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  Let bindings be the binding object for envRec.

3.  Return Put(bindings, N, V, and S).

GetBindingValue(N,S)

The con

crete Environment Record method GetBindingValue for object environment
records returns the value of its associated binding object’s property
whose name is the String value of the argument identifier N. The
property should already exist but if it does not the result depends upon
the value of the S argument:

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  Let bindingThis be the binding object for envRec.

3.  Let bindings be bindingThis.

4.  Repeat, while bindings is not NULL,

    a.  Let hasOwn be HasOwnProperty(bindings, N).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(hasOwn).

    c.  If hasOwn is TRUE, then

        i.  Let hasUnscopables be HasOwnProperty(bindings,
            @@unscopables).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(hasUnscopables).

        iii. Let isBlocked be FALSE.

        iv. If hasUnscopables is TRUE, then

            1.  Let unscopables be Get(bindings, @@unscopables).

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(unscopables).

            3.  If Type(unscopables) is Object, then

                a.  Let isBlocked be HasOwnProperty(unscopables,
                    N).

                b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(isBlocked).

        v.  If isBlocked is FALSE, then

            1.  Return the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method
                of bindings with arguments N and bindingThis.

    d.  Let bindings be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
        internal method of bindings with no arguments.

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(bindings).

5.  6.  7.  8.  If S is FALSE, return the value UNDEFINED, otherwise
    throw a REFERENCEERROR exception.

DeleteBinding (N)

The concrete Environment Record method DeleteBinding for object
environment records can only delete bindings that correspond to
properties of the environment object whose [[Configurable]] attribute
have the value TRUE.

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  Let bindings be the binding object for envRec.

3.  Return the result of calling the [[Delete]] internal method of
    bindings passing N as the argument.

HasThisBinding ()

Regular Object Environment Records do not provide a THIS binding.

1.  Return FALSE.

HasSuperBinding ()

Regular Object Environment Records do not provide a SUPER binding.

1.  Return FALSE.

 WithBaseObject()

Object Environment Records return UNDEFINED as their WithBaseObject
unless their withEnvironment flag is TRUE.

1.  Let envRec be the object environment record for which the method
    was invoked.

2.  If the withEnvironment flag of envRec is TRUE, return the
    binding object for envRec.

3.  Otherwise, return UNDEFINED.

Function Environment Records

A function environment record is a declarative environment record that
is used to represent the outer most scope of a function that provides a
THIS binding. In addition to its identifier bindings, a function
environment record contains the THIS value used within its scope. If
such a function references SUPER, its function environment record also
contains the state that is used to perform SUPER method invocations from
within the function.

Function environment records store their THIS binding as the value of
their thisValue. If the associated function references SUPER, the
environment record stores in HomeObject the object that the function
is bound to as a method and in MethodName the property key used for
unqualified super invocations from within the function. The default
value for HomeObject and MethodName is UNDEFINED.

Methods environment records support all of Declarative Environment
Record methods listed in Table 16 and share the same specifications for
all of those methods except for HasThisBinding and HasSuperBinding. In
addition, declarative environment records support the methods listed in
Table 17:

Table 17 — Additional Methods of Function Environment Records

  METHOD           PURPOSE
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GetThisBinding()   Return the value of this environment record’s THIS binding.
  GetSuperBase()     Return the object that is the base for SUPER property accesses bound in this environment record. The object is derived from this environment record’s HomeObject binding. If the value is Empty, return UNDEFINED.
  GetMethodName()    Return the value of this environment record’s MethodName binding.

The behaviour of the additional concrete specification methods for
Function Environment Records is defined by the following algorithms:

HasThisBinding ()

Function Environment Records always provide a THIS binding.

1.  Return TRUE.

HasSuperBinding ()

1.  If this environment record’s HomeObject has the value Empty, then
    return FALSE. Otherwise, return TRUE.

GetThisBinding ()

1.  Return the value of this environment record’s thisValue.

GetSuperBase ()

1.  Let home be the value of this environment record’s HomeObject.

2.  If home has the value Empty, then return UNDEFINED.

3.  Assert: Type(home) is Object.

4.  Return the result of calling home’s [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal
    method.

GetMethodName ()

1.  Return the value of this environment record’s MethodName.

Global Environment Records

A global environment record is used to represent the outer most scope
that is shared by all of the ECMAScript Script elements that are
processed in a common Realm (8.1.2.5). A global environment record
provides the bindings for built-in globals (clause 18), properties of
the global object, and for all declarations that are not function code
and that occur within Script productions.

A global environment record is logically a single record but it is
specified as a composite encapsulating an object environment record and
a declarative environment record. The object environment record has as
its base object the global object of the associated Realm. This global
object is also the value of the global environment record’s thisValue.
The object environment record component of a global environment record
contains the bindings for all built-in globals (clause 18) and all
bindings introduced by a FunctionDeclaration, GeneratorDeclaration,
or VariableStatement contained in global code. The bindings for all
other ECMAScript declarations in global code are contained in the
declarative environment record component of the global environment
record.

Properties may be created directly on a global object. Hence, the object
environment record component of a global environment record may contain
both bindings created explicitly by FunctionDeclaration,
GeneratorDeclaration, or VariableDeclaration declarations and
binding created implicitly as properties of the global object. In order
to identify which bindings were explicitly created using declarations, a
global environment record maintains a list of the names bound using its
CreateGlobalVarBindings and CreateGlobalFunctionBindings concrete
methods.

Global environment records have the additional state components listed
in Table 18 and the additional methods listed in Table 19.

Table 18 — Components of Global Environment Records

  COMPONENT         PURPOSE
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ObjectRecord        An Object Environment Record whose base object is the global object. It contains global built-in bindings as well as FunctionDeclaration, GeneratorDeclaration, and VariableDeclaration bindings in global code for the associated Realm.
  DeclarativeRecord   A Declarative Environment Record that contains bindings for all declarations in global code for the associated Realm code except for FunctionDeclaration, GeneratorDeclaration, and VariableDeclaration bindings.
  VarNames            A List containing the string names bound by FunctionDeclaration, GeneratorDeclaration, and VariableDeclaration declarations in global code for the associated Realm.

  GetThisBinding()                       Return the value of this environment record’s THIS binding.
  HasVarDeclaration (N)                  Determines if the argument identifier has a binding in this environment record that was created using a VariableDeclaration, FunctionDeclaration, or GeneratorDeclaration.
  HasLexicalDeclaration (N)              Determines if the argument identifier has a binding in this environment record that was created using a lexical declaration such as a LexicalDeclaration or a ClassDeclaration.
  CanDeclareGlobalVar (N)                Determines if a corresponding CreateGlobalVarBinding call would succeed if called for the same argument N.
  CanDeclareGlobalFunction (N)           Determines if a corresponding CreateGlobalFunctionBinding call would succeed if called for the same argument N.
  CreateGlobalVarBinding(N, D)           Used to create global VAR bindings in the ObjectRecord component of a global environment record. The binding will be a mutable binding. The corresponding global object property will have attribute values approate for a VAR. The String value N is the text of the bound name. D is TRUE the binding is may be subsequently deleted. This is logically equivalent to CreateMutableBinding but it allows var declarations to receive special treatment.
  CreateGlobalFunctionBinding(N, V, D)   Used to create and initialize global FUNCTION bindings in the ObjectRecord component of a global environment record. The binding will be a mutable binding. The corresponding global object property will have attribute values approate for a FUNCTION.The String value N is the text of the bound name. V is the initial value of the binding. If the optional Boolean argument D is TRUE the binding is may be subsequently deleted. This is logically equivalent to CreateMutableBinding followed by a SetMutableBinding but it allows function declarations to receive special treatment.

Code Realms

Before it is evaluated, all ECMAScript code must be associated with a
Realm. Conceptually, a realm consists of a set of intrinsic objects,
an ECMAScript global environment, all of the ECMAScript code that is
loaded within the scope of that global environment, a Loader object that
can associate new ECMAScript code with the realm, and other associated
state and resources.

A Realm is specified as a Record with the fields specified in Table 20:

Table 20 — Realm Record Fields

  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_              VALUE                                                                      MEANING

Execution Contexts

An _execution context_ is a specification device that is used to track
the runtime evaluation of code by an ECMAScript implementation. At any
point in time, there is at most one execution context that is actually
executing code. This is known as the running execution context. A
stack is used to track execution contexts. The running execution context
is always the top element of this stack. A new execution context is
created whenever control is transferred from the executable code
associated with the currently running execution context to executable
code that is not associated with that execution context. The newly
created execution context is pushed onto the stack and becomes the
running execution context.

An execution context contains whatever implementation specific state is
necessary to track the execution progress of its associated code. Each
execution context has at least the state components listed in Table 21.

Table 21 —State Components for All Execution Contexts

  COMPONENT             PURPOSE
  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  code evaluation state   Any state needed to perform, suspend, and resume evaluation of the code associated with this execution context.
  Function                If this execution context is evaluating the code of a function object, then the value of this is the that function. If the context is evaluation the code of a Script the value is NULL.
  Realm                   The Realm from which associated code accesses ECMAScript resources.

Evaluation of code by the running execution context may be suspended at
various points defined within this specification. Once the running
execution context has been suspended a different execution context may
become the running execution context and commence evaluating its code.
At some later time a suspended execution context may again become the
running execution context and continue evaluating its code at the point
where it had previously been suspended. Transition of the running
execution context status among execution contexts usually occurs in
stack-like last-in/first-out manner. However, some ECMAScript features
require non-LIFO transitions of the running execution context.

The value of the Realm component of the running execution context is
also called the _current Realm_. The value of the Function component of
the running execution context is also called the _active Function._

Execution contexts for ECMAScript code have the additional state
components listed in Table 22.

Table 22 — Additional State Components for ECMAScript Code Execution
Contexts

  COMPONENT           PURPOSE
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  LexicalEnvironment    Identifies the Lexical Environment used to resolve identifier references made by code within this execution context.
  VariableEnvironment   Identifies the Lexical Environment whose environment record holds bindings created by VariableStatements within this execution context.

The LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment components of an
execution context are always Lexical Environments. When an execution
context is created its LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment
components initially have the same value. The value of the
VariableEnvironment component never changes while the value of the
LexicalEnvironment component may change during execution of code within
an execution context.

Execution contexts representing the evaluation of generator objects have
the additional state components listed in Table 23.

Table 23 — Additional State Components for Generator Execution Contexts

  COMPONENT   PURPOSE
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Generator     The GeneratorObject that this execution context is evaluating.

In most situations only the running execution context (the top of the
execution context stack) is directly manipulated by algorithms within
this specification. Hence when the terms “LexicalEnvironment”, and
“VariableEnvironment” are used without qualification they are in
reference to those components of the running execution context.

An execution context is purely a specification mechanism and need not
correspond to any particular artefact of an ECMAScript implementation.
It is impossible for ECMAScript code to directly access or observe an
execution context.

ResolveBinding ( name ) Abstract Operation

The ResolveBinding abstract operation is used to determine the binding
of name passed as a string value using the LexicalEnvironment of the
running execution context. During execution of ECMAScript code,
ResolveBinding is performed using the following algorithm:

1.  Let env be the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment.

2.  If the syntactic production that is being evaluated is contained in
    strict mode code, then let strict be TRUE, else let strict be
    FALSE.

3.  Return GetIdentifierReference(env, name, strict ).

NOTE The result of ResolveBinding is always a Reference value with its
referenced name component equal to the name argument.

GetThisEnvironment ( ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation GetThisEnvironment finds the lexical environment
that currently supplies the binding of the keyword THIS.
GetThisEnvironment performs the following steps:

1.  Let lex be the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment.

2.  Repeat

    a.  Let envRec be lex’s environment record.

    b.  Let exists be the result of calling the HasThisBinding
        concrete method of envRec.

    c.  If exists is TRUE, then return envRec.

    d.  Let outer be the value of lex’s outer environment reference.

    e.  Let lex be outer.

NOTE The loop in step 2 will always terminate because the list of
environments always ends with the global environment which has a THIS
binding.

ResolveThisBinding ( ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation ResolveThisBinding determines the binding of the
keyword THIS using the LexicalEnvironment of the running execution
context. ResolveThisBinding performs the following steps:

1.  Let env be GetThisEnvironment( ).

2.  Return the result of calling the GetThisBinding concrete method of
    env.

GetGlobalObject ( ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation GetGlobalObject returns the global object used by
the currently running execution context. GetGlobalObject performs the
following steps:

1.  Let ctx be the running execution context.

2.  Let currentRealm be ctx’s Realm.

3.  Return currentRealm.[[globalThis]].


Jobs and Job Queues

A Job is an abstract operation that initiates an ECAMScript computation
when no other ECMAScript computation is currently in progress. A Job
abstract operation may be defined to accept an arbitrary set of job
parameters.

Execution of a Job can be initiated only when there is no running
execution context and the execution context stack is empty. A PendingJob
is a request for the future execution of a Job. A PendingJob is an
internal Record whose fields are specified in Table 24.

Table 24 — PendingJob Record Fields

  ----------------- -------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_      VALUE                                MEANING
  [[Job]]           The name of a Job abstract operation   This is the abstract operation that is performed when execution of this PendingJob is initiated. Jobs are abstract operations that use NextJob rather than Return to indicate that they have completed.
  [[Arguments]]     A List.                                The List of argument values that are to be passed to [[Job]] when it is activated.
  [[Realm]]         A Realm Record                         The Realm for the initial execution context when this Pending Job is initiated.
  [[HostDefined]]   Any, default value is UNDEFINED.       Field reserved for use by host environments that need to associate additional information with a pending Job.
  ----------------- -------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Job Queue is a FIFO queue of PendingJob records. Each Job Queue has a
name and the full set of available Job Queues are defined by an
ECMAScript implementation. Every ECMAScript implementation has at least
the Job Queues defined in Table 25.

Table 25 — Required Job Queues

  NAME        PURPOSE
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ScriptJobs    Jobs that validate and evaluate ECMAScript Script and Module code units. See clauses 10 and 15.
  PromiseJobs   Jobs that are responses to the settlement of a Promise (see 25.4).

A request for the future execution of a Job is made by enqueueing, on a
Job Queue, a PendingJob record that includes a Job abstract operation
name and any necessary argument values. When there is no running
execution context and the execution context stack is empty, the
ECMAScript implementation removes the first PendingJob from a Job Queue
and uses the information contained in it to create an execution context
and starts execution of the associated Job abstract operation.

The PendingJob records from a single Job Queue are always initiated in
FIFO order. This specification does not define the order in which
multiple Job Queues are serviced. An ECMAScript implementation may
interweave the FIFO evaluation of the PendingJob records of a Job Queue
with the evaluation of the PendingJob records of one or more other Job
Queues. An implementation must define what occurs when there are no
running execution context and all Job Queues are empty.

NOTE Typically an ECMAScript implementation will have its Job Queues
pre-initialized with at least one PendingJob and one of those Jobs will
be the first to be executed. An implementation might choose to free all
resources and terminate if the current Job completes and all Job Queues
are empty. Alternatively, it might choose to wait for a some
implementation specific agent or mechanism to enqueue new PendingJob
requests.

The following abstract operations are used to create and manage Jobs and
Job Queues:

EnqueueJob ( queueName, job, arguments) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation requires three arguments: queueName, job, and
arguments. It performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(queueName) is String and its value is the name of a
    Job Queue recognized by this implementation.

2.  Assert: job is the name of a Job.

3.  Assert: arguments is a List that has the same number of elements
    as the number of parameters required by job.

4.  Let callerContext be the running execution context.

5.  Let callerRealm be callerContext’s Realm.

6.  Let pending be PendingJob{ [[Job]]: job, [[Arguments]]:
    arguments, [[Realm]]: callerRealm, [[HostDefined]]: UNDEFINED }.

7.  Perform any implementation or host environment defined processing of
    pending. This may including modify the [[HostDefined]] field or
    any other field of pending.

8.  Add pending at the back of the Job Queue named by queueName.

9.  Return NormalCompletion(empty).

NextJob result 

An algorithm step such as:

1.  NextJob result.

is used in Job abstract operations in place of:

1.  Return result.

Job abstract operations must not contain a Return step or a
ReturnIfAbrupt step. The NextJob result operation is equivalent to the
following steps:

1.  If result is an abrupt completion, then perform implementation
    defined unhandled exception processing.

2.  Suspend the running execution context.

3.  Assert: The execution context stack is now empty.

4.  Let nextQueue be a non-empty Job Queue chosen in an implementation
    defined manner. If all Job Queues are empty, the result is
    implementation defined.

5.  Let nextPending be the PendingJob record at the front of
    nextQueue. Remove that record from nextQueue.

6.  Let newContext be a new execution context.

7.  Set newContext’s Realm to nextPending.[[Realm]].

8.  Push newContext onto the execution context stack; newContext is
    now the running execution context.

9.  Perform any implementation or host environment defined job
    initialization using nextPending.

10. Perform the abstract operation named by nextPending.[[Job]] using
    the elements of nextPending.[[Arguments]] as its arguments.


Initialization

An ECMAScript implementation performs the following steps prior to the
execution of any Jobs or the evaluation of any ECMAScript code:

1.  Let realm be CreateRealm().

2.  Let newContext be a new execution context.

3.  Set the Function of newContext to NULL.

4.  Set the Realm of newContext to realm.

5.  Push newContext onto the execution context stack; newContext is
    now the running execution context.

6.  Let status be InitializeFirstRealm(realm).

7.  If status is an abrupt completion, then

    a.  Assert: The first realm could not be created.

    b.  Terminate ECMAScript execution.

8.  In an implementation dependent manner, obtain the SourceCharacter
    sequence (see 10) for zero or more ECMAScript scripts. For each such
    sequence source do,

    a.  EnqueueJob("ScriptJobs", ScriptEvaluationJob, (source)).

9.  NextJob NormalCompletion(UNDEFINED).

InitializeFirstRealm ( realm ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation InitializeFirstRealm with parameter realm
performs the following steps:

1.  Let intrinsics be CreateIntrinsics(realm).

2.  If this implementation requires use of an exotic object to serve as
    realm’s global object, then let global be such an object created
    in an implementation defined manner. Otherwise, let global be
    UNDEFINED indicating that an ordinary object should be created as
    the global object.

3.  Perform SetRealmGlobalObject(realm, global).

4.  Let globalObj be SetDefaultGlobalBindings(realm).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(globalObj).

6.  Create any implementation defined global object properties on
    globalObj.

7.  Return NormalCompletion(UNDEFINED).



ORDINARY AND EXOTIC OBJECTS BEHAVIOURS 


Ordinary Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots

All ordinary objects have an internal slot called [[Prototype]]. The
value of this internal slot is either NULL or an object and is used for
implementing inheritance. Data properties of the [[Prototype]] object
are inherited (are visible as properties of the child object) for the
purposes of get access, but not for set access. Accessor properties are
inherited for both get access and set access.

Every ordinary object has a Boolean-valued [[Extensible]] internal slot
that controls whether or not properties may be added to the object. If
the value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot is FALSE then additional
properties may not be added to the object. In addition, if
[[Extensible]] is FALSE the value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of
the object may not be modified. Once the value of an object’s
[[Extensible]] internal slot has been set to FALSE it may not be
subsequently changed to TRUE.

In the following algorithm descriptions, assume O is an ordinary
object, P is a property key value, V is any ECMAScript language
value, and Desc is a Property Descriptor record.

        ii. Let nextp be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
            internal method of p with no arguments.

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(nextp).

        iv. Let p be nextp.

OrdinaryGetOwnProperty (O, P)

When the abstract operation OrdinaryGetOwnProperty is called with Object
O and with property key P, the following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: IsPropertyKey(P) is TRUE.

2.  If O does not have an own property with key P, return UNDEFINED.

3.  Let D be a newly created Property Descriptor with no fields.

4.  Let X be O’s own property whose key is P.

5.  If X is a data property, then

    a.  Set D.[[Value]] to the value of X’s [[Value]] attribute.

    b.  Set D.[[Writable]] to the value of X’s [[Writable]]
        attribute

6.  Else X is an accessor property, so

    a.  Set D.[[Get]] to the value of X’s [[Get]] attribute.

    b.  Set D.[[Set]] to the value of X’s [[Set]] attribute.

Current the following steps are taken:

1.  Return ValidateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor(UNDEFINED, UNDEFINED,
    Extensible, Desc, Current).

ValidateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor (O, P, extensible, Desc, current)

When the abstract operation ValidateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor is called
with Object O, property key P, Boolean value extensible, and
Property Descriptors Desc, and current the following steps are
taken:

This algorithm contains steps that test various fields of the Property
Descriptor Desc for specific values. The fields that are tested in
this manner need not actually exist in Desc. If a field is absent then
its value is considered to be FALSE.

NOTE If UNDEFINED is passed as the O argument only validation is
performed and no object updates are performed.

1.  Assert: If O is not UNDEFINED then P is a valid property key.

2.  If current is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If extensible is FALSE, then return FALSE.

    b.  Assert: extensible is TRUE.

    c.  If IsGenericDescriptor(Desc) or IsDataDescriptor(Desc) is
        TRUE, then

        i.  If O is not UNDEFINED, then create an own data property
            named P of object O whose [[Value]], [[Writable]],
            [[Enumerable]] and [[Configurable]] attribute values are
            described by Desc. If the value of an attribute field of
            Desc is absent, the attribute of the newly created
            property is set to its default value.

    d.  Else Desc must be an accessor Property Descriptor,

        i.  If O is not UNDEFINED, then create an own accessor
            property named P of object O whose [[Get]], [[Set]],
            [[Enumerable]] and [[Configurable]] attribute values are
            described by Desc. If the value of an attribute field of
            Desc is absent, the attribute of the newly created
            property is set to its default value.

    e.  Return TRUE.

3.  Return TRUE, if every field in Desc is absent.

4.  Return TRUE, if every field in Desc also occurs in current and
    the value of every field in Desc is the same value as the
    corresponding field in current when compared using the SameValue
    algorithm.

5.  If the [[Configurable]] field of current is FALSE then

    a.  Return FALSE, if the [[Configurable]] field of Desc is TRUE.

    b.  Return FALSE, if the [[Enumerable]] field of Desc is present
        and the [[Enumerable]] fields of current and Desc are the
        Boolean negation of each other.

6.  If IsGenericDescriptor(Desc) is TRUE, then no further validation
    is required.

7.  Else if IsDataDescriptor(current) and IsDataDescriptor(Desc)
    have different results, then

    a.  Return FALSE, if the [[Configurable]] field of current is
        FALSE.

    b.  If IsDataDescriptor(current) is TRUE, then

        i.  If O is not UNDEFINED, then convert the property named P
            of object O from a data property to an accessor property.
            Preserve the existing values of the converted property’s
            [[Configurable]] and [[Enumerable]] attributes and set the
            rest of the property’s attributes to their default values.

    c.  Else,

        i.  If O is not UNDEFINED, then convert the property named P
            of object O from an accessor property to a data property.
            Preserve the existing values of the converted property’s
            [[Configurable]] and [[Enumerable]] attributes and set the
            rest of the property’s attributes to their default values.

8.  Else if IsDataDescriptor(current) and IsDataDescriptor(Desc) are
    both TRUE, then

    a.  If the [[Configurable]] field of current is FALSE, then

        i.  Return FALSE, if the [[Writable]] field of current is
            FALSE and the [[Writable]] field of Desc is TRUE.

        ii. If the [[Writable]] field of current is FALSE, then

            1.  Return FALSE, if the [[Value]] field of Desc is
                present and SameValue(Desc.[[Value]],
                current.[[Value]]) is FALSE.

    b.  Else the [[Configurable]] field of current is TRUE, so any
        change is acceptable.

9.  Else IsAccessorDescriptor(current) and
    IsAccessorDescriptor(Desc) are both TRUE,

    a.  If the [[Configurable]] field of current is FALSE, then

        i.  Return FALSE, if the [[Set]] field of Desc is present and
            SameValue(Desc.[[Set]], current.[[Set]]) is FALSE.

        ii. Return FALSE, if the [[Get]] field of Desc is present and
            SameValue(Desc.[[Get]], current.[[Get]]) is FALSE.

10. If O is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  For each field of Desc that is present, set the corresponding
        attribute of the property named P of object O to the value
        of the field.

11. Return TRUE.

NOTE Step 8.b allows any field of Desc to be different from the
corresponding field of current if current’s [[Configurable]] field is
TRUE. This even permits changing the [[Value]] of a property whose
[[Writable]] attribute is FALSE. This is allowed because a TRUE
[[Configurable]] attribute would permit an equivalent sequence of calls
where [[Writable]] is first set to TRUE, a new [[Value]] is set, and
then [[Writable]] is set to FALSE.

When the [[HasProperty]] internal method of O is called with property
key P, the following steps are taken:

5.  Let parent be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
    internal method of O.

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(parent).

7.  If parent is not NULL, then

    a.  Return the result of calling the [[HasProperty]] internal method
        of parent with argument P.

8.  Return FALSE.

2.  Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal
    method of O with argument P.

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(desc).

4.  If desc is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let parent be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
        internal method of O.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(parent).

    c.  If parent is NULL, then return UNDEFINED.

    d.  Return the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of
        parent with arguments P and Receiver.

5.  If IsDataDescriptor(desc) is TRUE, return desc.[[Value]].

6.  Otherwise, IsAccessorDescriptor(desc) must be TRUE so, let
    getter be desc.[[Get]].

7.  If getter is UNDEFINED, return UNDEFINED.

8.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
    getter with Receiver as the thisArgument and an empty List as
    argumentsList.

[[Set]] ( P, V, Receiver)

When the [[Set]] internal method of O is called with property key P,
value V, and ECMAScript language value Receiver, the following steps
are taken:

1.  Assert: IsPropertyKey(P) is TRUE.

2.  Let ownDesc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]]
    internal method of O with argument P.

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(ownDesc).

4.  If ownDesc is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let parent be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
        internal method of O.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(parent).

    c.  If parent is not NULL, then

        i.  Return the result of calling the [[Set]] internal method of
            parent with arguments P, V, and Receiver.

    d.  Else,

        i.  Let ownDesc be the PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]:
            UNDEFINED, [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE,
            [[Configurable]]: TRUE}.

5.  If IsDataDescriptor(ownDesc) is TRUE, then

    a.  If ownDesc.[[Writable]] is FALSE, return FALSE.

    b.  If Type(Receiver) is not Object, return FALSE.

    c.  Let existingDescriptor be the result of calling the
        [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of Receiver with argument
        P.

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(existingDescriptor).

    e.  If existingDescriptor is not UNDEFINED, then

        i.  Let valueDesc be the PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: V}.

        ii. Return the result of calling the [[DefineOwnProperty]]
            internal method of Receiver with arguments P and

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(setterResult).

    e.  Return TRUE.

 [[Delete]] (P)

When the [[Delete]] internal method of O is called with property key
P the following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: IsPropertyKey(P) is TRUE.

2.  Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal
    method of O with argument P.

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(desc).

4.  If desc is UNDEFINED, then return TRUE.

5.  If desc.[[Configurable]] is TRUE, then

    a.  Remove the own property with name P from O.

    b.  Return TRUE.

6.  Return FALSE.

[[Enumerate]] ()

When the [[Enumerate]] internal method of O is called the following
steps are taken:

1.  Return an Iterator object (25.1.2) whose NEXT method iterates over
    all the String-valued keys of enumerable properties of O. The
    mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified
    but must conform to the rules specified below.

The iterator’s NEXT method processes object properties to deterime
whether the property key should be returned as an iterator value.
Processed properties do not include properties whose property key is a
Symbol. Properties of the object being enumerated may be deleted during
enumeration. A property that is deleted before it is processed by the
iterator’s NEXT method is ignored. If new properties are added to the
object being enumerated during enumeration, the newly added properties
are not guaranteed to be processed in the active enumeration. A property
name will be return by the iterator’s NEXT method at most once in any
enumeration.

Enumerating the properties of an object includes processing properties
of its prototype, and the prototype of the prototype, and so on,
recursively; but a property of a prototype is not processed if has the
same name as a property that has already been processed by the
iterator’s NEXT method. The values of [[Enumerable]] attributes are not
considered when determining if a property of a prototype object has
already been processed.

The following is an informative definition of an ECMAScript generator
function that conforms to these rules:

function* enumerate(obj) {

if (Object(obj)!== obj) return undefined;

let visited = new Set;

while (obj !== null) {

for (name of Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)) {

//any new properties added to obj by vistor are ignored.

if (!visited.has(name)) {

let desc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj,name);

if (desc) {

visited.add(name);

if (desc.enumerable) yield name;

}

}

}

obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);

}

}

[[OwnPropertyKeys]] ( )

When the [[OwnPropertyKeys]] internal method of O is called the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let keys be a new empty List.

2.  For each own property key P of O that is an integer index, in
    ascending numeric index order

    a.  Add P as the last element of keys.

3.  For each own property key P of O that is a String but is not an
    integer index, in property creation order

    a.  Add P as the last element of keys.

4.  For each own property key P of O that is a Symbol, in property
    creation order

    a.  Add P as the last element of keys.

5.  Return CreateArrayFromList(keys).

ObjectCreate(proto, internalSlotsList) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation ObjectCreate with argument proto (an object or
null) is used to specify the runtime creation of new ordinary objects.
The optional argument internalSlotsList is a List of the names of
additional internal slots that must be defined as part of the object. If
the list is not provided, an empty List is used. This abstract operation
performs the following steps:

1.  If internalSlotsList was not provided, let internalSlotsList be
    an empty List.

2.  Let obj be a newly created object with an internal slot for each
    name in internalSlotsList.

3.  Set obj’s essential internal methods to the default ordinary
    object definitions specified in 9.1.

4.  Set the [[Prototype]] internal slot of obj to proto.

5.  Set the [[Extensible]] internal slot of obj to TRUE.

6.  Return obj.

OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor ( constructor, intrinsicDefaultProto, internalSlotsList )

The abstract operation OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor creates an ordinary
object whose [[Prototype]] value is retrieved from a constructor’s
PROTOTYPE property, if it exists. Otherwise the supplied default is used
for [[Prototype]]. The optional internalSlotsList is a List of the
names of additional internal slots that must be defined as part of the
object. If the list is not provided, an empty List is used. This
abstract operation performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: intrinsicDefaultProto is a string value that is this
    specification’s name of an intrinsic object. The corresponding
    object must be an intrinsic that is intended to be used as the
    [[Prototype]] value of an object.

2.  Let proto be GetPrototypeFromConstructor(constructor,
    intrinsicDefaultProto).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

4.  Return ObjectCreate(proto, internalSlotsList).


ECMAScript Function Objects

ECMAScript function objects encapsulate parameterized ECMAScript code
closed over a lexical environment and support the dynamic evaluation of
that code. An ECMAScript function object is an ordinary object and has
the same internal slots and (except as noted below) and the same
internal methods as other ordinary objects. The code of an ECMAScript
function object may be either strict mode code (10.2.1) or non-strict
mode code.

ECMAScript function objects have the additional internal slots listed in
Table 26.

ECMAScript function objects whose code is not strict mode code (10.2.1)
provide an alternative definition for the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal
method. This alternative prevents the value of strict mode function from
being revealed as the value of a function object property named
"CALLER". The alternative definition exist solely to preclude a
non-standard legacy feature of some ECMAScript implementations from
revealing information about strict mode callers. If an implementation
does not provide such a feature, it need not implement this alternative
internal method for ECMAScript function objects. ECMAScript function
objects are considered to be ordinary objects even though they may use
the alternative definition of [[GetOwnProperty]].

Table 26 — Internal Slots of ECMAScript Function Objects

  _INTERNAL SLOT_        TYPE                      DESCRIPTION
  ---------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[Environment]]        Lexical Environment         The Lexical Environment that the function was closed over. Used as the outer environment when evaluating the code of the function.
  [[FormalParameters]]   Parse Node                  The root parse node of the source code that defines the function’s formal parameter list.
  [[FunctionKind]]       String                      Either "NORMAL" or "GENERATOR".
  [[Code]]               Parse Node                  The root parse node of the source code that defines the function’s body.
  [[Realm]]              Realm Record                The Code Realm in which the function was created and which provides any intrinsic objects that are accessed when evaluating the function.
  [[ThisMode]]           (lexical, strict, global)   Defines how THIS references are interpreted within the formal parameters and code body of the function. LEXICAL means that THIS refers to the THIS value of a lexically enclosing function. STRICT means that the THIS value is used exactly as provided by an invocation of the function. GLOBAL means that a THIS value of UNDEFINED is interpreted as a reference to the global object.
  [[Strict]]             Boolean                     TRUE if this is a strict mode function, FALSE if this is not a strict mode function.
  [[NeedsSuper]]         Boolean                     TRUE if this function uses SUPER.
  [[HomeObject]]         Object                      If the function uses SUPER, this is the object whose [[GetPrototypeOf]] provides the object where SUPER property lookups begin.
  [[MethodName]]         String or Symbol            If the function uses SUPER, this is the property key that is used for unqualified references to SUPER.

All ECMAScript function objects have the [[Call]] internal method
defined here. ECMAScript functions that are also constructors in
addition have the [[Construct]] internal method. ECMAScript function
objects whose code is not strict mode code have the [[Get]] and
[[GetOwnProperty]] internal methods defined here.

[[GetOwnProperty]] (P)

When the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of non-strict ECMAScript
function object F is called with property key P, the following steps
are taken:

1.  Let v be OrdinaryGetOwnProperty(F, P).

2.  3.  If IsDataDescriptor(v) is TRUE, then

    a.  If P is "CALLER" then,

        i.  Let callerValue be v.[[Value]].

        ii. If callerValue is an ECMAScript Function object, then

            1.  If callerValue’s [[Strict]] internal slot is TRUE,
                then set v.[[Value]] to NULL.

4.  Return v.

If an implementation does not provide a built-in CALLER property for
non-strict ECMAScript function objects then it must not use this
definition. Instead the ordinary object [[GetOwnProperty]] internal
method is used.

[[Call]] ( thisArgument, argumentsList) 

The [[Call]] internal method for an ECMAScript function object F is
called with parameters thisArgument and argumentsList, a List of
ECMAScript language values. The following steps are taken:

1.  If F’s [[Code]] internal slot has the value UNDEFINED, then throw
    a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  Let callerContext be the running execution context.

3.  If callerContext is not already suspended, then Suspend
    callerContext.

4.  Let calleeContext be a new ECMAScript Code execution context.

5.  Set the Function of calleeContext to F.

6.  Let calleeRealm be the value of F’s [[Realm]] internal slot.

7.  Set the Realm of calleeContext to calleeRealm.

8.  Let thisMode be the value of F’s [[ThisMode]] internal slot.

9.  Let needsThisWrapper be FALSE.

10. If thisMode is lexical, then

    a.  Let localEnv be the result of calling
        NewDeclarativeEnvironment passing the value of the
        [[Environment]] internal slot of F as the argument.

11. Else,

    a.  If thisMode is strict, then let thisValue be thisArgument.

    b.  Else

        i.  if thisArgument is NULL or UNDEFINED, then

            1.  Let thisValue be calleeRealm.[[globalThis]].

        ii. Else

            1.  if Type(thisArgument) is not Object, then let
                needsThisWrapper be TRUE.

            2.  Let thisValue be thisArgument.

    c.  Let localEnv be NewFunctionEnvironment(F, thisValue).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(localEnv).

    e.  NOTE Any exception objects produced by NewFunctionEnvironment
        are associated with callerReam.

12. Set the LexicalEnvironment of calleeContext to localEnv.

13. Set the VariableEnvironment of calleeContext to localEnv.

14. Push calleeContext onto the execution context stack;
    calleeContext is now the running execution context.

15. If needsThisWrapper is TRUE then,

    a.  Let wrapperedThis be ToObject(thisArgument).

    b.  Assert: wrapperedThis is not an abrupt completion.

    c.  NOTE Wrappering deferred until calleeContext is running so
        that ToObject produces objects using calleeRealm.

    d.  Let functionEnv be localEnv’s environment record.

    e.  Set functionEnv’s thisValue to wrapperedThis.

16. Let status be the result of performing
    FunctionDeclarationInstantiation using the function F,
    argumentsList , and localEnv as described in 9.2.13.

17. If status is an abrupt completion, then

    a.  Remove calleeContext from the execution context stack and
        restore callerContext as the running execution context.

    b.  Return status.

18. Let result be the result of EvaluateBody of the production that is
    the value of F's [[Code]] internal slot passing F as the
    argument.

19. Remove calleeContext from the execution context stack and restore
    callerContext as the running execution context.

20. Return result.

NOTE 1 Most ECMAScript functions use a Function Environment Record as
their LexicalEnvironment. ECMAScript functions that are arrow functions
use a Declarative Environment Record as their LexicalEnvironment.

properties of the function object, except for the restricted function
properties, are not created or copied.

FunctionDeclarationInstantiation(func, argumentsList, env ) Abstract Operation

NOTE When an execution context is established for evaluating an
ECMAScript function a new Declarative Environment Record is created and
bindings for each formal parameter are instantiated in that environment
record. Each declaration in the function body is also instantiated. If
the function’s formal parameters do not include any default value
initializers then the body declarations are instantiated in the same
environment record as the parameters. If default value parameter
initializers exist, a second environment record is created for the body
declarations. Formal parameters and functions are initialized as part of
FunctionDeclarationInstantiation. All other bindings are initialized
during evaluation of the function body.

FunctionDeclarationInstantiation is performed as follows using arguments
_func, argumentsList_, and env. func is the function object that for
which the execution context is being established. env is the

    a.  Let alreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s
        HasBinding concrete method passing paramName as the argument.

        occur in non-strict functions that do not have parameter default
        values or rest parameters.

    c.  If alreadyDeclared is FALSE, then

        i.  Let status be the result of calling env’s

Built-in Function Objects

The built-in function objects defined in this specification may be
implemented as either ECMAScript function objects (9.2) whose behaviour
is provided using ECMAScript code or as implementation provided exotic
function objects whose behaviour is provided in some other manner. In
either case, the effect of calling such functions must conform to their
specifications.

If a built-in function object is implemented as an exotic object it must
have the ordinary object behaviour specified in 9.1 except
[[GetOwnProperty]] which must be as specified in 9.2.1. All such exotic
function objects also have [[Prototype]] and [[Extensible]] internal
slots.

Unless otherwise specified every built-in function object initially has
the %FunctionPrototype% object (19.2.3) as the initial value of its
[[Prototype]] internal slot.

The behaviour specified for each built-in function via algorithm steps
or other means is the specification of the [[Call]] behaviour for that
function with the [[Call]] thisArgument providing the THIS value and
the [[Call]] argumentsList providing the named parameters for each
built-in function. If the built-in function is implemented as an
ECMAScript function object then this specified behaviour must be
implemented by the ECMAScript code that is the body of the function.
Built-in functions that are ECMAScript function objects must be strict
mode functions.

Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not
implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified
in the description of a particular function. When a built-in constructor
is called as part of a NEW expression the argumentsList parameter of
the invoked [[Construct]] internal method provides the values for the
built-in constructor’s named parameters.

Built-in functions that are not constructors do not have a PROTOTYPE
property unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
function.

If a built-in function object is not implemented as an ECMAScript
function it must have a [[Realm]] internal slot. It must also have a
[[Call]] internal method that conforms to the following definition:

[[Call]] ( thisArgument, argumentsList) 

The [[Call]] internal method for a built-in function object F is
called with parameters thisArgument and argumentsList, a List of
ECMAScript language values. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let callerContext be the running execution context.

2.  If callerContext is not already suspended, then Suspend
    callerContext.

3.  Let calleeContext be a new execution context.

4.  Set the Function of calleeContext to F.

5.  Let calleeRealm be the value of F’s [[Realm]] internal slot.

6.  Set the Realm of calleeContext to calleeRealm.

7.  Perform any necessary implementation defined initialization of
    calleeContext.

8.  Push calleeContext onto the execution context stack;
    calleeContext is now the running execution context.

9.  Let result be the Completion Record that is the result of
    evaluating F in an implementation defined manner that conforms to
    this specification of F.

10. Remove calleeContext from the execution context stack and restore
    callerContext as the running execution context.

11. Return result.

NOTE 1 When calleeContext is removed from the execution context stack
it must not be destroyed because it may have been suspended and retained
by a generator object for later resumption.

CreateBuiltinFunction(realm, steps, prototype, internalSlotsList) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CreateBuiltinFunction takes arguments realm,
prototype, and steps. The optional argument internalSlotsList is a
List of the names of additional internal slot that must be defined as
part of the object. If the list is not provided, an empty List is used.
CreateBuiltinFunction returns a built-in function object created by the
following steps:

1.  Assert: realm is a Realm Record.

2.  Assert: steps is either a set of algorithm steps or other
    definition of a functions behaviour provided in this specification.

3.  Let func be a new built-in function object that when called
    performs the action described by steps. The new function object
    has internal slots whose names are the elements of
    internalSlotsList. The initial value of each of those internal
    slots is UNDEFINED.

4.  Set the [[Realm]] internal slot of func to realm.

5.  Call the [[SetPrototypeOf]] internal method of func with argument
    prototype.

6.  Perform the AddRestrictedFunctionProperties(func, realm).

7.  Return func.


Built-in Exotic Object Internal Methods and Data Fields

This specification defines several kinds of built-in exotic objects.
These objects generally behave similar to ordinary objects except for a
few specific situations. The following exotic objects use the ordinary
object internal methods except where it is explicitly specified
otherwise below:

Bound Function Exotic Objects

A _bound function_ is an exotic object that wrappers another function
object. A bound function is callable (it has a [[Call]] internal method
and may have a [[Construct]] internal method). Calling a bound function
generally results in a call of its wrapped function.

Bound function objects do not have the internal slots of ECMAScript
function objects defined in Table 26. Instead they have the internal
slots defined in Table 27.

Table 27 — Internal Slots of Exotic Bound Function Objects

  _INTERNAL SLOT_           TYPE            DESCRIPTION
  ------------------------- ----------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[BoundTargetFunction]]   Callable Object   The wrappered function object.
  [[BoundThis]]             Any               The value that is always passed as the THIS value when calling the wrappered function.
  [[BoundArguments]]        List of Any       A list of values that whose elements are used as the first arguments to any call to the wrappered function.

Unlike ECMAScript function objects, bound function objects do not use
alternative definitions of the [[Get]] and [[GetOwnProperty]] internal
methods. Bound function objects provide all of the essential internal
methods as specified in 9.1. However, they use the following definitions
for the essential internal methods of function objects.

[[Call]]

When the [[Call]] internal method of an exotic bound function object,
F, which was created using the bind function is called with parameters
thisArgument and argumentsList, a List of ECMAScript language
values, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let boundArgs be the value of F’s [[BoundArguments]] internal
    slot.

2.  Let boundThis be the value of F’s [[BoundThis]] internal slot.

3.  Let target be the value of F’s [[BoundTargetFunction]] internal
    slot.

4.  Let args be a new list containing the same values as the list
    boundArgs in the same order followed by the same values as the
    list argumentsList in the same order.

5.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
    target providing boundThis as thisArgument and providing
    args as argumentsList.

[[Construct]]

When the [[Construct]] internal method of an exotic bound function
object, F that was created using the bind function is called with a
list of arguments ExtraArgs, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let target be the value of F’s [[BoundTargetFunction]] internal
    slot.

2.  Assert: target has a [[Construct]] internal method.

3.  Let boundArgs be the value of F’s [[BoundArguments]] internal
    slot.

4.  Let args be a new list containing the same values as the list
    boundArgs in the same order followed by the same values as the
    list ExtraArgs in the same order.

5.  Return the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal method of
    target providing args as the arguments.

BoundFunctionCreate (targetFunction, boundThis, boundArgs) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation BoundFunctionCreate with arguments
targetFunction, boundThis and boundArgs is used to specify the
creation of new Bound Function exotic objects. It performs the following
steps:

1.  Let proto be the intrinsic %FunctionPrototype%.

3.  Set obj’s essential internal methods to the default ordinary
    object definitions specified in 9.1.

4.  Set the [[Call]] internal method of obj as described in 9.4.1.1.

2.  3.  Let new be a new Bound Function exotic object that has all of
    the same internal methods and internal slots as function.

4.  Set the value of each of new’s internal slots, except for
    [[Extensible]] to the value of function’s corresponding internal
    slot.

5.  Set new’s [[Extensible]] internal slot to TRUE.

Array Exotic Objects

An _Array object_ is an exotic object that gives special treatment to
array index property keys (see 6.1.7). A property whose property name is
an array index is also called an element. Every Array object has a
LENGTH property whose value is always a nonnegative integer less than
2^32^. The value of the LENGTH property is numerically greater than the
name of every property whose name is an array index; whenever a property
of an Array object is created or changed, other properties are adjusted
as necessary to maintain this invariant. Specifically, whenever a
property is added whose name is an array index, the LENGTH property is
changed, if necessary, to be one more than the numeric value of that
array index; and whenever the LENGTH property is changed, every property
whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new
length is automatically deleted. This constraint applies only to own
properties of an Array object and is unaffected by LENGTH or array index
properties that may be inherited from its prototypes.

NOTE A String property name P is an _array index_ if and only if
ToString(ToUint32(P)) is equal to P and ToUint32(P) is not equal
to 2^32^−1.

Exotic Array objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects.
They also have an [[ArrayInitializationState]] internal slot.

Exotic Array objects always have a non-configurable property named
"LENGTH".

Exotic Array objects provide an alternative definition for the
[[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method. Except for that internal method,
exotic Array objects provide all of the other essential internal methods
as specified in 9.1.

[[DefineOwnProperty]] ( P, Desc)

When the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of an exotic Array object
A is called with property key P, and Property Descriptor Desc the
following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: IsPropertyKey(P) is TRUE.

2.  If P is "LENGTH", then

    a.  Return ArraySetLength(A, Desc).

3.  Else if P is an array index, then

    a.  Let oldLenDesc be OrdinaryGetOwnProperty(A, "LENGTH").

    b.  Assert: oldLenDesc will never be UNDEFINED or an accessor
        descriptor because Array objects are created with a length data
        property that cannot be deleted or reconfigured.

    c.  Let oldLen be oldLenDesc.[[Value]].

    d.  Let index be ToUint32(P).

    e.  f.  Assert: index will never be an abrupt completion.

    g.  If index ≥ oldLen and oldLenDesc.[[Writable]] is FALSE,
        then return FALSE.

    h.  Let succeeded be the result of calling
        OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty passing A, P, and Desc as
        arguments.

    i.  ReturnIfAbrupt(succeeded).

    j.  If succeeded is FALSE, then return FALSE.

    k.  If index ≥ oldLen

        i.  Set oldLenDesc.[[Value]] to index + 1.

        ii. Let succeeded be OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, "LENGTH",
            oldLenDesc).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(succeeded).

    l.  Return TRUE.

4.  Return OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, P, Desc).

ArrayCreate(length, proto) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation ArrayCreate with argument length (a positive
integer or UNDEFINED) and optional argument proto is used to specify
the creation of new exotic Array objects. It performs the following
steps:

1.  Assert: length is either UNDEFINED or a integer Number ≥ 0.

2.  If length is −0, then let length be +0.

3.  If the proto argument was not passed, then let proto be the
    intrinsic object %ArrayPrototype%.

4.  Let A be a newly created Array exotic object.

5.  Set A’s essential internal methods except for
    [[DefineOwnProperty]] to the default ordinary object definitions
    specified in 9.1.

6.  Set the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of A as specified in
    9.4.2.1.

    a.  Set the [[ArrayInitializationState]] internal slot of A to
        FALSE.

12. Call OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty with arguments A, "LENGTH" and
    PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: length, [[Writable]]: TRUE,
    [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE}.

13. Return A.

ArraySetLength(A, Desc) Abstract Operation

When the abstract operation ArraySetLength is called with an exotic
Array object A, and Property Descriptor Desc the following steps are
taken:

1.  If the [[Value]] field of Desc is absent, then

    a.  Return OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, "LENGTH", Desc).

2.  Let newLenDesc be a copy of Desc.

3.  Let newLen be ToUint32(Desc.[[Value]]).

4.  If newLen is not equal to ToNumber( Desc.[[Value]]), throw a
    RANGEERROR exception.

5.  Set newLenDesc.[[Value]] to newLen.

6.  Let oldLenDesc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]]
    internal method of A passing "LENGTH" as the argument.

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(oldLenDesc).

8.  Assert: oldLenDesc will never be UNDEFINED or an accessor
    descriptor because Array objects are created with a length data
    property that cannot be deleted or reconfigured.

9.  Let oldLen be oldLenDesc.[[Value]].

10. If newLen ≥oldLen, then

    a.  Return OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, "LENGTH", newLenDesc).

11. If oldLenDesc.[[Writable]] is FALSE, then return FALSE.

12. If newLenDesc.[[Writable]] is absent or has the value TRUE, let
    newWritable be TRUE.

13. Else,

    a.  Need to defer setting the [[Writable]] attribute to FALSE in
        case any elements cannot be deleted.

    b.  Let newWritable be FALSE.

    c.  Set newLenDesc.[[Writable]] to TRUE.

    a.  Set oldLen to oldLen – 1.

    b.  Let deleteSucceeded be the result of calling the [[Delete]]
        internal method of A passing ToString(oldLen).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(succeeded).

    d.  If deleteSucceeded is FALSE, then

        i.  Set newLenDesc.[[Value]] to oldLen+1.

        ii. If newWritable is FALSE, set newLenDesc.[[Writable]] to
            FALSE.

        iii. Let succeeded be OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, "LENGTH",
            newLenDesc).

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(succeeded).

        v.  Return FALSE.

18. If newWritable is FALSE, then

    a.  Call OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty passing A, "LENGTH", and
        PropertyDescriptor{[[Writable]]: FALSE} as arguments. This call
        will always return TRUE.

19. Return TRUE.

NOTE In steps 3 and 4, if Desc.[[Value]] is an object then its VALUEOF
method is called twice. This is legacy behaviour that was specified with
this effect starting with the 2^nd^ Edition of this specification.

String Exotic Objects

A _String object_ is an exotic object that encapsulates a String value
and exposes virtual integer indexed data properties corresponding to the
individual code unit elements of the string value. Exotic String objects
always have a data property named "LENGTH" whose value is the number of
code unit elements in the encapsulated String value. Both the code unit
data properties and the "LENGTH" property are non-writable and
non-configurable.

Exotic String objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects.
They also have a [[StringData]] internal slot.

Exotic String objects provide alternative definitions for the following
internal methods. All of the other exotic String object essential
internal methods that are not defined below are as specified in 9.1.

14. If index < 0 or len ≤ index, return UNDEFINED.

15. Let resultStr be a String value of length 1, containing one code
    unit from str, specifically the code unit at position index,
    where the first (leftmost) element in str is considered to be at
    position 0, the next one at position 1, and so on.

16. Return a PropertyDescriptor{ [[Value]]: resultStr, [[Enumerable]]:
    TRUE, [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

 [[Enumerate]] ()

When the [[Enumerate]] internal method of an exotic String object O is
called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let indexKeys be a new empty List.

2.  Let str be the String value of the [[StringData]] internal slot of
    O, if the value of [[StringData]] is UNDEFINED the empty string is
    used as its value.

9.  Return A.

Arguments Exotic Objects

Most ECMAScript functions make an arguments objects available to their
code. Depending upon the characteristics of the function definition, its
argument object is either an ordinary object or an _arguments exotic
object_. An aguments exotic object is an exotic object whose array index
properties map to the formal parameters bindings of an invocation of its
associated ECMAScript function.

Arguments exotic objects have the same internal slots as ordinary
objects. They also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot. Ordinary
arguments objects also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot whose value
is always undefined. For ordinany argument objects the [[ParameterMap]]
internal slot is only used by OBJECT.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING (19.1.3.6) to
identify them as such.

Arguments exotic objects provide alternative definitions for the
following internal methods. All of the other exotic arguments object
essential internal methods that are not defined below are as specified
in 9.1

NOTE 1 For non-strict mode functions the integer indexed data properties
of an arguments object whose numeric name values are less than the
number of formal parameters of the corresponding function object
initially share their values with the corresponding argument bindings in
the function’s execution context. This means that changing the property
changes the corresponding value of the argument binding and vice-versa.
This correspondence is broken if such a property is deleted and then
redefined or if the property is changed into an accessor property. For
strict mode functions, the values of the arguments object’s properties
are simply a copy of the arguments passed to the function and there is
no dynamic linkage between the property values and the formal parameter
values.

NOTE 2 The ParameterMap object and its property values are used as a
device for specifying the arguments object correspondence to argument
bindings. The ParameterMap object and the objects that are the values of
its properties are not directly observable from ECMAScript code. An
ECMAScript implementation does not need to actually create or use such
objects to implement the specified semantics.

NOTE 3 Arguments objects for strict mode functions define
non-configurable accessor properties named "CALLER" and "CALLEE" which
throw a TYPEERROR exception on access. The "CALLEE" property has a more
specific meaning for non-strict mode functions and a "CALLER" property
has historically been provided as an implementation-defined extension by
some ECMAScript implementations. The strict mode definition of these
properties exists to ensure that neither of them is defined in any other
manner by conforming ECMAScript implementations.

 [[GetOwnProperty]] (P)

The [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of an arguments exotic object
when called with a property name P performs the following steps:

1.  Let args be the arguments object.

2.  Let desc be OrdinaryGetOwnProperty(args, P).

3.  If desc is UNDEFINED then return desc.

4.  Let map be the value of the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot of the
    arguments object.

5.  Let isMapped be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]]
    internal method of map passing P as the argument.

6.  Assert: isMapped is never an abrupt completion.

7.  If the value of isMapped is true, then

    a.  Set desc.[[Value]] to Get(map, P).

1.  If IsDataDescriptor(desc) is TRUE and P is "CALLER" and
    desc.[[Value]] is a strict mode Function object, throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

1.  Return desc.

If an implementation does not provide a built-in CALLER property for
argument exotic objects then step 8 of this algorithm is must be
skipped.

 [[DefineOwnProperty]] (P, Desc)

The [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of an arguments exotic object
when called with a property name P and Property Descriptor Desc
performs the following steps:

1.  Let args be the arguments object.

2.  Let map be the value of the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot of the
    arguments object.

3.  Let isMapped be HasOwnProperty(map, P).

4.  Let allowed be OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(args, P, Desc).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(allowed).

6.  If allowed is FALSE, then return FALSE.

7.  If the value of isMapped is TRUE, then

    a.  If IsAccessorDescriptor(Desc) is TRUE, then

        i.  Call the [[Delete]] internal method of map passing P as
            the argument.

    b.  Else

        i.  If Desc.[[Value]] is present, then

            1.  Let putStatus be Put(map, P, Desc.[[Value]],
                FALSE).

            2.  Assert: putStatus is TRUE because formal parameters
                mapped by argument objects are always writable.

        ii. If Desc.[[Writable]] is present and its value is FALSE,
            then

            1.  Call the [[Delete]] internal method of map passing P
                as the argument.

8.  Return TRUE.

[[Get]] (P, Receiver)

The [[Get]] internal method of an arguments exotic object when called
with a property name P and ECMAScript language value Receiver
performs the following steps:

1.  Let args be the arguments object.

2.  Let map be the value of the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot of the
    arguments object.

3.  Let isMapped be HasOwnProperty(map, P).

4.  Assert: isMapped is not an abrupt completion.

5.  If the value of isMapped is FALSE, then

    a.  Let v be the result of calling the default ordinary object
        [[Get]] internal method (9.1.8) on args passing P and
        Receiver as the arguments.

6.  Else map contains a formal parameter mapping for P,

    a.  Let v be Get(map, P).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(v).

8.  If P is "CALLER" and v is a strict mode Function object, throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

9.  Return v.

If an implementation does not provide a built-in CALLER property for
argument exotic objects then step 8 of this algorithm must be skipped.

 [[Set]] ( P, V, Receiver)

The [[Set]] internal method of an arguments exotic object when called
with property key P, value V, and ECMAScript language value
Receiver performs the following steps:

1.  Let args be the arguments object.

2.  If SameValue(args, Receiver) is FALSE, then

    a.  Let isMapped be UNDEFINED.

3.  Else,

    a.  Let map be the value of the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot of
        the arguments object.

    b.  Let isMapped be HasOwnProperty(map, P).

    c.  Assert: isMapped is not an abrupt completion.

4.  If the value of isMapped is FALSE, then

    a.  Return the result of calling the default ordinary object [[Set]]
        internal method (9.1.8) on args passing P, V and
        Receiver as the arguments.

5.  Else map contains a formal parameter mapping for P,

    a.  Return Put(map, P, V, FALSE).

 [[Delete]] (P)

The [[Delete]] internal method of an arguments exotic object when called
with a property key P performs the following steps:

1.  Let map be the value of the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot of the
    arguments object.

2.  Let isMapped be HasOwnProperty(map, P).

3.  Assert: isMapped is not an abrupt completion.

4.  Let result be the result of calling the default [[Delete]]
    internal method for ordinary objects (9.1.10) on the arguments
    object passing P as the argument.

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(result).

6.  If result is TRUE and the value of isMapped is TRUE, then

    a.  Call the [[Delete]] internal method of map passing P as the
        argument.

7.  Return result.

NOTE 1 For non-strict mode functions with simple parameter lists, those
integer indexed data properties of an arguments object whose numeric
name values are less than the number of formal parameters of the
function initially share their values with the corresponding argument
bindings in the function’s execution context. This means that changing
the property changes the corresponding value of the argument binding and
vice-versa. This correspondence is broken if such a property is deleted
and then redefined or if the property is changed into an accessor
property. For strict mode functions, the values of the arguments
object’s properties are simply a copy of the arguments passed to the
function and there is no dynamic linkage between the property values and
the formal parameter values.

NOTE 2 The ParameterMap object and its property values are used as a
device for specifying the arguments object correspondence to argument
bindings. The ParameterMap object and the objects that are the values of
its properties are not directly accessible from ECMAScript code. An
ECMAScript implementation does not need to actually create or use such
objects to implement the specified semantics.

NOTE 3 Arguments objects for strict mode functions define
non-configurable accessor properties named "CALLER" and "CALLEE" which
throw a TYPEERROR exception on access. The "CALLEE" property has a more
specific meaning for non-strict mode functions and a "CALLER" property
has historically been provided as an implementation-defined extension by
some ECMAScript implementations. The strict mode definition of these
properties exists to ensure that neither of them is defined in any other
manner by conforming ECMAScript implementations.

Module Exotic Objects

A _module object_ is an exotic object that exposes the bindings exported
from an ECMAScript Module (See 15.1.9). There is a one-to-one
correspondence between the own properties of a module exotic object and
the ExportedBindings of the Module. Each own property name is the
StringValue of the corresponding exported binding. These are the only
properties of a module exotic object. Each such property has the
attributes {[[Configurable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE}. Module
objects are not extensible.

Module objects have the internal slots defined in Table 28.

Table 28 — Internal Slots of Module Exotic Objects

  _INTERNAL SLOT_         TYPE           DESCRIPTION
  ----------------------- ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[ModuleEnvironment]]   Environment      The Declarative Environment Record that contains all of the declared top-level bindings for the corresponding module.

Proxy Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots

A proxy object is an exotic object whose essential internal methods are
partially implemented using ECMAScript code. Every proxy objects has an
internal slot called [[ProxyHandler]]. The value of [[ProxyHandler]] is
always an object, called the proxy’s _handler object_. Methods (see
Table 29) of a handler object may be used to augment the implementation
for one or more of the proxy object’s internal methods. Every proxy
object also has an internal slot called [[ProxyTarget]] whose value is
either an object or the NULL value. This object is called the proxy’s
_target object_.

Table 29 — Proxy Handler Methods

  _INTERNAL METHOD_       _HANDLER METHOD_
  ----------------------- --------------------------
  [[GetPrototypeOf]]      GETPROTOTYPEOF
  [[SetPrototypeOf]]      SETPROTOTYPEOF
  [[IsExtensible]]        ISEXTENSIBLE
  [[PreventExtensions]]   PREVENTEXTENSIONS
  [[GetOwnProperty]]      GETOWNPROPERTYDESCRIPTOR
  [[HasProperty]]         HAS
  [[Get]]                 GET
  [[Set]]                 SET
  [[Delete]]              DELETEPROPERTY
  [[DefineOwnProperty]]   DEFINEPROPERTY
  [[Enumerate]]           ENUMERATE
  [[OwnPropertyKeys]]     OWNKEYS
  [[Call]]                APPLY
  [[Construct]]           CONSTRUCT

When a handler method is called to provide the implementation of a proxy
object internal method, the handler method is passed the proxy’s target
object as a parameter. A proxy’s handler object does not necessarily
have a method corresponding to every essential internal method. Invoking
an internal method on the proxy results in the invocation of the
corresponding internal method on the proxy’s target object if the
handler object does not have a method corresponding to the internal
trap.

The [[ProxyHandler]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots of a proxy
object are always initialized when the object is created and typically
may not be modified. Some proxy objects are created in a manner that
permits them to be subsequently revoked. When a proxy is revoked, its
[[ProxyHander]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots are set to NULL
causing subsequent invocations of internal methods on that proxy obeject
to throw a TYPEERROR exception.

Because proxy permit arbitrary ECMAScript code to be used to in the
implementation of internal methods, it is possible to define a proxy
object whose handler methods violates the invariants defined in 6.1.7.3.
Some of the internal method invariants defined in 6.1.7.3 are essential
integrity invariants. These invariants are explicitly enforced by the
proxy internal methods specified in this section. An ECMAScript
implementation must be robust in the presence of all possible invariant
violations.

In the following algorithm descriptions, assume O is an ECMAScript
proxy object, P is a property key value, V is any ECMAScript
language value, Desc is a Property Descriptor record, and B is a
Boolean flag.

[[GetPrototypeOf]] ( )

When the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method of an exotic Proxy object
O is called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let handler be the value of the [[ProxyHandler]] internal slot of
    O.

2.  If handler is NULL, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let target be the value of the [[ProxyTarget]] internal slot of
    O.

4.  Let trap be GetMethod(handler, "GETPROTOTYPEOF").

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(trap).

6.  If trap is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Return the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal
        method of target.

7.  Let handlerProto be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
    method of trap with handler as the THIS value and a new List
    containing target.

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(handlerProto).

9.  If Type(handlerProto) is neither Object nor Null, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

10. Let extensibleTarget be IsExtensible(target).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(extensibleTarget).

12. If extensibleTarget is TRUE, then return handlerProto.

13. Let targetProto be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
    internal method of target.

14. ReturnIfAbrupt(targetProto).

15. If SameValue(handlerProto, targetProto) is FALSE, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

16. Return handlerProto.

NOTE [[GetPrototypeOf]] for proxy objects enforces the following
invariant:

-   The result of [[GetPrototypeOf]] must be either an Object or NULL.

-   If the target object is not extensible, [[GetPrototypeOf]] applied
    to the proxy object must return the same value as [[GetPrototypeOf]
    applied to the proxy object’s target object.

[[SetPrototypeOf]] (V)

When the [[SetPrototypeOf]] internal method of an exotic Proxy object
O is called with argument V the following steps are taken:

1.  Assert: Either Type(V) is Object or Type(V) is Null.

2.  Let handler be the value of the [[ProxyHandler]] internal slot of
    O.

3.  If handler is NULL, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Let target be the value of the [[ProxyTarget]] internal slot of
    O.

5.  Let trap be GetMethod(handler, "SETPROTOTYPEOF").

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(trap).

7.  If trap is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Return the result of calling the [[SetPrototypeOf]] internal
        method of target with argument V.

8.  Let trapResult be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
    method of trap with handler as the THIS value and a new List
    containing target and V.

9.  Let booleanTrapResult be ToBoolean(trapResult).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(booleanTrapResult).

11. Let extensibleTarget be IsExtensible(target).

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(extensibleTarget).

13. If extensibleTarget is TRUE, then return booleanTrapResult.

14. Let targetProto be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]]
    internal method of target.

15. ReturnIfAbrupt(targetProto).

16. If booleanTrapResult is TRUE and SameValue(V, targetProto) is
    FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

17. Return booleanTrapResult.

NOTE [[SetPrototypeOf]] for proxy objects enforces the following
invariant:

-   If the target object is not extensible, the argument value must be
    the same as the result of [[GetPrototypeOf]] applied to target
    object.

[[IsExtensible]] ( )

ECMASCRIPT LANGUAGE: SOURCE CODE


Source Text

Syntax

SourceCharacter ::

  any Unicode code point

The ECMAScript code is expressed using Unicode, version 5.1 or later.
ECMAScript source text is a sequence of code points. All Unicode code
point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including surrogate code points,
may occur in source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The
actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is
not relevant to this specification. Regardless of the external source
text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript implementation processes the
source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of SourceCharacter
values. Each SourceCharacter being a Unicode code point. Conforming
ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalization
of text, or behave as though they were performing normalization of text.

The components of a combining character sequence are treated as
individual Unicode code points even though a user might think of the
whole sequence as a single character.

NOTE In string literals, regular expression literals, template literals
and identifiers, any Unicode code point may also be expressed using
Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express a code point’s numeric
value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored
as part of the comment.

ECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour
of Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape
sequence \U000A, for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is
interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode code point U+000A is line
feed) and therefore the next code point is not part of the comment.
Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence \U000A occurs within a string
literal in a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line
terminator, which is not allowed within a string literal—one must write
\N instead of \U000A to cause a line feed to be part of the string value
of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence
occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot
contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape
sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript program
always contributes to the literal and is never interpreted as a line
terminator or as a quote mark that might terminate the string literal.

Static Semantics: UTF-16Encoding

The UTF-16Encoding of a numeric code point value, cp, is determined as
follows:

1.  Assert: 0 ≤ cp ≤ 0x10FFFF.

2.  If cp ≤ 65535, then return cp.

3.  Let cu1 be floor((cp – 65536) / 1024) + 0xD800.

4.  Let cu2 be ((cp – 65536) modulo 1024) + 0xDC00.

5.  Return the code unit sequence consisting of cu1 followed by cu2.

Static Semantics: UTF16Decode(lead, trail)

Two code units, lead and trail, that form a UTF-16 surrogate pair
are converted to a code point by performing the following steps:

1.  Assert: 0xD800 ≤ lead ≤ 0xDBFF and 0xDC00 ≤ trail ≤ 0xDFFF.

2.  Let cp be (lead–0xD800)×1024+( trail–0xDC00)+0x10000.

3.  Return the code point cp.


Types of Source Code

There are four types of ECMAScript code:

-   _Global code_ is source text that is treated as an ECMAScript
      Script. The global code of a particular Script does not
      include any source text that is parsed as part of a
      FunctionBody, GeneratorBody, ConciseBody, ClassBody, or
      ModuleBody.

-   _Eval code_ is the source text supplied to the built-in EVAL
      function. More precisely, if the parameter to the built-in EVAL
      function is a String, it is treated as an ECMAScript Script. The
      eval code for a particular invocation of EVAL is the global code
      portion of that Script.

-   _Function code_ is source text that is parsed to supply the value of
      the [[Code]] internal slot (see 9.1.14) of function and generator
      objects. It includes the code that defines and initializes the
      formal parameters of the function. The _function code_ of a
      particular function or generator does not include any source text
      that is parsed as the function code of a nested FunctionBody,
      GeneratorBody, ConciseBody, or ClassBody.

-   _Module code_ is source text that is code that is provided as a
      ModuleBody. It is the code that is directly evaluated when a
      module is initialized. The module code of a particular module does
      not include any source text that is parsed as part of a nested
      FunctionBody, GeneratorBody, ConciseBody, ClassBody, or
      ModuleBody.

NOTE Function code is generally provided as the bodies of Function
Definitions (14.1), Arrow Function Definitions (14.2), Method
Definitions (14.3) and Generator Definitions (14.4). Function code is
also derived from the last argument to the Function constructor
(19.2.1.1) and the GeneratorFunction constructor (25.2.1.1).

Strict Mode Code

An ECMAScript Script syntactic unit may be processed using either
unrestricted or strict mode syntax and semantics. When processed using
strict mode the four types of ECMAScript code are referred to as module
code, strict global code, strict eval code, and strict function code.
Code is interpreted as strict mode code in the following situations:

-   Global code is strict global code if it begins with a Directive
      Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive (see 14.1.1).

-   Module code is always strict code.

-   All parts of a ClassDeclaration or a ClassExpression are strict
      code.

-   Eval code is strict eval code if it begins with a Directive Prologue
      that contains a Use Strict Directive or if the call to eval is a
      direct call (see 18.2.1.1) to the eval function that is contained
      in strict mode code.

-   Function code that is part of a FunctionDeclaration,
      FunctionExpression, GeneratorDeclaration,
      GeneratorExpression, MethodDefinition, or ArrowFunction is
      strict function code if its GeneratorDeclaration,
      GeneratorExpression, MethodDefinition, or ArrowFunction is
      contained in strict mode code or if its FunctionBody begins with
      a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.

-   Function code that is supplied as the last argument to the built-in
      Function constructor is strict function code if the last argument
      is a String that when processed as a FunctionBody begins with a
      Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.

Non-ECMAScript Functions

An ECMAScript implementation may support the evaluation of exotic
function objects whose evaluative behaviour is expressed in some
implementation defined form of executable code other than via ECMAScript
code. Whether a function object is an ECMAScript code function or a
non-ECMAScript function is not semantically observable from the
perspective of an ECMAScript code function that calls or is called by
such a non-ECMAScript function.



ECMASCRIPT LANGUAGE: LEXICAL GRAMMAR


The source text of an ECMAScript script is first converted into a
sequence of input elements, which are tokens, line terminators,
comments, or white space. The source text is scanned from left to right,
repeatedly taking the longest possible sequence of code units as the
next input element.

There are several situations where the identification of lexical input
elements is sensitive to the syntactic grammar context that is consuming
the input elements. This requires multiple goal symbols for the lexical
grammar. The InputElementDiv goal symbol is the default goal symbol
and is used in those syntactic grammar contexts where a leading division
(/) or division-assignment (/=) operator is permitted. The
InputElementRegExp goal symbol is used in all syntactic grammar
contexts where a RegularExpressionLiteral is permitted. The
InputElementTemplateTail goal is used in syntactic grammar contexts
where a TemplateLiteral logically continues after a substitution
element.

NOTE There are no syntactic grammar contexts where both a leading
division or division-assignment, and a leading
RegularExpressionLiteral are permitted. This is not affected by
semicolon insertion (see 11.9); in examples such as the following:

  A = B
  /HI/G.EXEC(C).MAP(D);

where the first non-whitespace, non-comment code point after a
LineTerminator is slash (/) and the syntactic context allows division
or division-assignment, no semicolon is inserted at the
LineTerminator. That is, the above example is interpreted in the same
way as:

  A = B / HI / G.EXEC(C).MAP(D);

Unicode Format-Control Characters

The Unicode format-control characters (i.e., the characters in category
“Cf” in the Unicode Character Database such as left-to-right mark or
right-to-left mark) are control codes used to control the formatting of
a range of text in the absence of higher-level protocols for this (such
as mark-up languages).

It is useful to allow format-control characters in source text to
facilitate editing and display. All format control characters may be
used within comments, and within string literals, template literals, and
regular expression literals.

U+200C (Zero width non-joiner) and U+200D (Zero width joiner) are
format-control characters that are used to make necessary distinctions
when forming words or phrases in certain languages. In ECMAScript source
text these code points may also be used in an IdentifierName (see
11.6.1) after the first character.

U+FEFF (Byte Order Mark) is a format-control character used primarily at
the start of a text to mark it as Unicode and to allow detection of the
text's encoding and byte order. <BOM> characters intended for this
purpose can sometimes also appear after the start of a text, for example
as a result of concatenating files. In ECMAScript source text <BOM> code
points are treated as white space characters (see 11.2).

The special treatment of certain format-control characters outside of
comments, string literals, and regular expression literals is summarized
in Table 30.

Table 30 — Format-Control Code Point Usage

  --------------- ----------------------- ---------------- ------------------
  _CODE POINT _   NAME                  ABBREVIATION   USAGE

  U+FEFF          Byte Order Mark         <BOM>            Whitespace
  --------------- ----------------------- ---------------- ------------------


White Space

White space code points are used to improve source text readability and
to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other, but are
otherwise insignificant. White space code points may occur between any
two tokens and at the start or end of input. White space code points may
occur within a StringLiteral, a RegularExpressionLiteral, a
Template, or a TemplateSubstitutionTail where they are considered
significant code points forming part of a literal value. They may also
occur within a Comment, but cannot appear within any other kind of
token.

The ECMAScript white space code points are listed in Table 31.

Table 31 — Whitespace Code Point

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ----------------
  _CODE POINT _         NAME                                            ABBREVIATION

  Other category “Zs”   Any other Unicode “Separator, space” code point   <USP>
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ----------------

ECMAScript implementations must recognize as Whitespace code points
listed in the “Separator, space” (Zs) category by Unicode 5.1.
ECMAScript implementations may also recognize as Whitespace additional
category Zs code points from subsequent editions of the Unicode
Standard.

NOTE Other than for the code points listed in Table 31, ECMAScript
Whitespace intentionally excludes all code points that have the
Unicode “White_Space” property but which are not classified in category
“Zs”.

Syntax

Line Terminators

Like white space code points, line terminator code points are used to
improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible
lexical units) from each other. However, unlike white space code points,
line terminators have some influence over the behaviour of the syntactic
grammar. In general, line terminators may occur between any two tokens,
but there are a few places where they are forbidden by the syntactic
grammar. Line terminators also affect the process of automatic semicolon
insertion (11.9). A line terminator cannot occur within any token except
a StringLiteral, Template, or TemplateSubstitutionTail. Line
terminators may only occur within a StringLiteral token as part of a
LineContinuation.

A line terminator can occur within a MultiLineComment (11.4) but
cannot occur within a SingleLineComment.

Line terminators are included in the set of white space code points that
are matched by the \S class in regular expressions.

The ECMAScript line terminator code points are listed in Table 32.

Table 32 — Line Terminator Code Points

  --------------- --------------------- ----------------
  _CODE POINT _   _UNICODE NAME_        ABBREVIATION
  U+000A          Line Feed             <LF>
  U+000D          Carriage Return       <CR>
  U+2028          Line separator        <LS>
  U+2029          Paragraph separator   <PS>
  --------------- --------------------- ----------------

Only the Unicode code points in Table 32 are treated as line
terminators. Other new line or line breaking Unicode code points are not
treated as line terminators but are treated as white space if they meet
the requirements listed in Table 31. The sequence <CR><LF> is commonly
used as a line terminator. It should be considered a single
SourceCharacter for the purpose of reporting line numbers.

Syntax

LineTerminator ::

<LF>
<CR>
<LS>
<PS>

LineTerminatorSequence ::

<LF>
<CR> [lookahead ∉ <LF> ]
<LS>
<PS>
<CR> <LF>


Comments

Comments can be either single or multi-line. Multi-line comments cannot
nest.

Because a single-line comment can contain any Unicode code point except
a LineTerminator code point, and because of the general rule that a
token is always as long as possible, a single-line comment always
consists of all code points from the // marker to the end of the line.
However, the LineTerminator at the end of the line is not considered
to be part of the single-line comment; it is recognized separately by
the lexical grammar and becomes part of the stream of input elements for
the syntactic grammar. This point is very important, because it implies
that the presence or absence of single-line comments does not affect the
process of automatic semicolon insertion (see 11.9).

Comments behave like white space and are discarded except that, if a
MultiLineComment contains a line terminator code point, then the
entire comment is considered to be a LineTerminator for purposes of
parsing by the syntactic grammar.

Names and Keywords

IdentifierName and ReservedWord are tokens that are interpreted
according to the Default Identifier Syntax given in Unicode Standard
Annex #31, Identifier and Pattern Syntax, with some small modifications.
ReservedWord is an enumerated subset of IdentifierName. The
syntactic grammer defines Identifier as an IdentifierName that is
not a ReservedWord (see 11.6.2). The Unicode identifier grammar is
based on character properties specified by the Unicode Standard. The
Unicode code points in the specified categories in version 5.1.0 of the
Unicode standard must be treated as in those categories by all
conforming ECMAScript implementations. ECMAScript implementations may
recognize identifier code points defined in later editions of the
Unicode Standard.

NOTE 1 This standard specifies specific code point additions: U+0024
(dollar sign) and U+005F (LOW LINE) are permitted anywhere in an
IdentifierName, and the characters U+200C (zero-width non-joiner) and
U+200D (zero-width joiner) are permitted anywhere after the first code
unit of an IdentifierName.

Unicode escape sequences are permitted in an IdentifierName, where
they contribute a single Unicode code point to the IdentifierName. The
code point is expressed by the HexDigits of the
UnicodeEscapeSequence (see 11.8.4). The \ preceding the
UnicodeEscapeSequence and the U and { } code units, if they appear, do
not contribute code points to the IdentifierName. A
UnicodeEscapeSequence cannot be used to put a code point into an
IdentifierName that would otherwise be illegal. In other words, if a \
UnicodeEscapeSequence sequence were replaced by the SourceCharacter
it contributes, the result must still be a valid IdentifierName that
has the exact same sequence of SourceCharacter elements as the
original IdentifierName. All interpretations of IdentifierName
within this specification are based upon their actual code points
regardless of whether or not an escape sequence was used to contribute
any particular code point.

Two IdentifierName that are canonically equivalent according to the
Unicode standard are not equal unless they are represented by the
exact same sequence of code points (in other words, conforming
ECMAScript implementations are only required to do bitwise comparison on
IdentifierName values).

Syntax

The definitions of the nonterminal UnicodeEscapeSequence is given in
11.8.4.

Identifier Names

Static Semantics: Early Errors

IdentifierStart :: \ UnicodeEscapeSequence

-   It is a Syntax Error if SV(UnicodeEscapeSequence) is neither the
    UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) of a single Unicode code point with the
    Unicode property “ID_Start” nor "$" or "_".

IdentifierPart :: \ UnicodeEscapeSequence

-   It is a Syntax Error if SV(UnicodeEscapeSequence) is neither the
    UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) of a single Unicode code point with the
    Unicode property “ID_Continue” nor "$" or "_" nor the UTF-16Encoding
    of either <ZWNJ> or <ZWJ>.

Static Semantics: StringValue

See also: 11.8.4.2, 12.1.3.

IdentifierName ::

IdentifierStart
IdentifierName IdentifierPart

1.  Return the String value consisting of the sequence of code units
    corresponding to IdentifierName. In determining the sequence any
    occurrences of \ UnicodeEscapeSequence are first replaced with the
    code point represented by the UnicodeEscapeSequence and then the
    code points of the entire IdentifierName are converted to code
    units by UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) each code point.

Reserved Words

A reserved word is an IdentifierName that cannot be used as an
Identifier.

Syntax

ReservedWord ::

Keyword
FutureReservedWord
NullLiteral
BooleanLiteral

NOTE The ReservedWord definitions are specified as literal sequences
of specific SourceCharacter elements. A code point in a ReservedWord
cannot be expressed by a \ UnicodeEscapeSequence.

Keywords

The following tokens are ECMAScript keywords and may not be used as
Identifiers in ECMAScript programs.

Syntax

Keyword :: ONE OF

  ---------- ---------- ------------ --------
  break      do         in           typeof
  case       else       instanceof   var

  class      extends    return       while
  const      finally    super        with
  continue   for        switch       yield
  debugger   function   this         
  default    if         throw        
  delete     import     try          
  ---------- ---------- ------------ --------

NOTE In some contexts YIELD is given the semantics of an Identifier.
See 12.1.1. In strict mode code, LET is treated as a keyword through
static semantic restrictions (see 12.1.1, 12.2.4.2.1, 13.2.1.1,
13.6.4.1, and 14.5.1) rather than the lexical grammar.

Future Reserved Words

The following words are used as keywords in proposed extensions and are
therefore reserved to allow for the possibility of future adoption of
those extensions.

Syntax

FutureReservedWord ::

  ------- -- -- --
  enum          
  await         
  ------- -- -- --

AWAIT is only treated as a FutureReservedWord when Module is the
goal symbol of the syntactic grammar.

NOTE Use of the following tokens within strict mode code (see 10.2.1) is
also reserved. That usage is restricted using static semantic
restrictions (see 12.1.1) rather than the lexical grammar:

  ------------ --------- ----------- --------
  implements   package   protected   static
  interface    private   public

LegacyOctalIntegerLiteral as described in B.1.1.

Once the exact MV for a numeric literal has been determined, it is then
rounded to a value of the Number type. If the MV is 0, then the rounded
value is +0; otherwise, the rounded value must be the Number value for
the MV (as specified in 6.1.6), unless the literal is a DecimalLiteral
and the literal has more than 20 significant digits, in which case the
Number value may be either the Number value for the MV of a literal
produced by replacing each significant digit after the 20th with a 0
digit or the Number value for the MV of a literal produced by replacing
each significant digit after the 20th with a 0 digit and then
incrementing the literal at the 20th significant digit position. A digit
is significant if it is not part of an ExponentPart and

-   it is not 0; or

-   there is a nonzero digit to its left and there is a nonzero digit,
    not in the ExponentPart, to its right.

String Literals

NOTE A string literal is zero or more Unicode code points enclosed in
single or double quotes. Unicode code points may also be represented by
an escape sequence. All code points may appear literally in a string
literal except for the closing quote code points, backslash, carriage
return, line separator, paragraph separator, and line feed. Any code
points may appear in the form of an escape sequence. String literals
evaluate to ECAMScript String values. When generating these string
values Unicode code points are UTF-16 encoded as defined in 10.1.1. Code
points belonging to Basic Multilingual Plane are encoded as a single
code unit element of the string. All other code points are encoded as
two code unit elements of the string.

Regular Expression Literals

NOTE A regular expression literal is an input element that is converted
to a RegExp object (see 21.1.5) each time the literal is evaluated. Two
regular expression literals in a program evaluate to regular expression
objects that never compare as === to each other even if the two
literals' contents are identical. A RegExp object may also be created at
runtime by NEW REGEXP (see 21.2.3.2) or calling the REGEXP constructor
as a function (21.2.3.1).

The productions below describe the syntax for a regular expression
literal and are used by the input element scanner to find the end of the
regular expression literal. The source code comprising the
RegularExpressionBody and the RegularExpressionFlags are
subsequently parsed using the more stringent ECMAScript Regular
Expression grammar (21.2.1).

An implementation may extend the ECMAScript Regular Expression grammar
defined in 21.2.1, but it must not extend the RegularExpressionBody
and RegularExpressionFlags productions defined below or the
productions used by these productions.

NOTE TemplateSubstitutionTail is used by the
InputElementTemplateTail alternative lexical goal.

Static Semantics: TV’s and TRV’s

A template literal component is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode
code points. The Template Value (TV) of a literal component is described
in terms of code unit values (CV, 11.8.4) contributed by the various
parts of the template literal component. As part of this process, some
Unicode code points within the template component are interpreted as
having a mathematical value (MV, 11.8.3). In determining a TV, escape
sequences are replaced by the UTF-16 code unit(s) of the Unicode code
point represented by the escape sequence. The Template Raw Value (TRV)
is similar to a Template Value with the difference that in TRVs escape
sequences are interpreted literally.

Automatic Semicolon Insertion

Certain ECMAScript statements (empty statement, LET, CONST, IMPORT,
EXPORT, AND MODULE declarations, variable statement, expression
statement, DEBUGGER statement, CONTINUE statement, BREAK statement,
RETURN statement, and THROW statement) must be terminated with
semicolons. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in the source
text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the
source text in certain situations. These situations are described by
saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code
token stream in those situations.

Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion

There are three basic rules of semicolon insertion:

1.  When, as the script is parsed from left to right, a token (called
    the _offending token_) is encountered that is not allowed by any
    production of the grammar, then a semicolon is automatically
    inserted before the offending token if one or more of the following
    conditions is true:

-   The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least
      one LineTerminator.

-   The offending token is }.

    1.  When, as the script is parsed from left to right, the end of the
        input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable
        to parse the input token stream as a single complete ECMAScript
        script, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end
        of the input stream.

    2.  When, as the script is parsed from left to right, a token is
        encountered that is allowed by some production of the grammar,
        but the production is a _restricted production_ and the token
        would be the first token for a terminal or nonterminal
        immediately following the annotation “[no LineTerminator
        here]” within the restricted production (and therefore such a
        token is called a restricted token), and the restricted token is
        separated from the previous token by at least one
        LineTerminator, then a semicolon is automatically inserted
        before the restricted token.

However, there is an additional overriding condition on the preceding
rules: a semicolon is never inserted automatically if the semicolon
would then be parsed as an empty statement or if that semicolon would
become one of the two semicolons in the header of a FOR statement (see
13.6.3).

NOTE The following are the only restricted productions in the grammar:

PostfixExpression~[Yield]~ :

LeftHandSideExpression~[?Yield]~ [no LineTerminator here] ++
LeftHandSideExpression~[?Yield]~ [no LineTerminator here] --

ContinueStatement~[Yield]~ :

CONTINUE;
CONTINUE [no LineTerminator here] LabelIdentifier~[?Yield]~ ;

BreakStatement~[Yield]~ :

BREAK ;
BREAK [no LineTerminator here] LabelIdentifier~[?Yield]~ ;

ReturnStatement~[Yield]~ :

RETURN [no LineTerminator here] Expression ;
RETURN [no LineTerminator here] Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ;

ThrowStatement~[Yield]~ :

THROW [no LineTerminator here] Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ;

ArrowFunction~[In,\ Yield]~ :

ArrowParameters~[?Yield]~ [no LineTerminator here] =>
ConciseBody~[?In]~

YieldExpression~[In]~ :

YIELD [no LineTerminator here] * [Lexical goal InputElementRegExp]
AssignmentExpression~[?In,\ Yield]~
YIELD [no LineTerminator here] [Lexical goal InputElementRegExp]
AssignmentExpression~[?In,\ Yield]~

ModuleImport :

MODULE [no LineTerminator here] ImportedBinding FromClause ;

The practical effect of these restricted productions is as follows:

  When a ++ or -- token is encountered where the parser would treat it
  as a postfix operator, and at least one LineTerminator occurred
  between the preceding token and the ++ or -- token, then a semicolon
  is automatically inserted before the ++ or -- token.

  When a CONTINUE, BREAK, RETURN, THROW, or YIELD token is encountered
  and a LineTerminator is encountered before the next token, a
  semicolon is automatically inserted after the CONTINUE, BREAK, RETURN,
  THROW, or YIELD token.

The resulting practical advice to ECMAScript programmers is:

  A postfix ++ or -- operator should appear on the same line as its
  operand.

  An Expression in a RETURN or THROW statement or an
  AssignmentExpression in a YIELD expression should start on the same
  line as the RETURN, THROW, or YIELD token.

  An IdentifierReference in a BREAK or CONTINUE statement should be on
  the same line as the BREAK or CONTINUE token.

Examples of Automatic Semicolon Insertion

The source

  { 1 2 } 3

is not a valid sentence in the ECMAScript grammar, even with the
automatic semicolon insertion rules. In contrast, the source

  { 1
  2 } 3

is also not a valid ECMAScript sentence, but is transformed by automatic
semicolon insertion into the following:

  { 1
  ;2 ;} 3;

which is a valid ECMAScript sentence.

The source

  for (a; b
  )

is not a valid ECMAScript sentence and is not altered by automatic
semicolon insertion because the semicolon is needed for the header of a
FOR statement. Automatic semicolon insertion never inserts one of the
two semicolons in the header of a FOR statement.

The source

  return
  a + b

is transformed by automatic semicolon insertion into the following:

  return;
  a + b;

NOTE The expression A + B is not treated as a value to be returned by
the RETURN statement, because a LineTerminator separates it from the
token RETURN.

The source

  a = b
  ++c

is transformed by automatic semicolon insertion into the following:

  a = b;
  ++c;

NOTE The token ++ is not treated as a postfix operator applying to the
variable B, because a LineTerminator occurs between B and ++.

The source

  if (a > b)
  else c = d

is not a valid ECMAScript sentence and is not altered by automatic
semicolon insertion before the ELSE token, even though no production of
the grammar applies at that point, because an automatically inserted
semicolon would then be parsed as an empty statement.

The source

  a = b + c
  (d + e).print()

is not transformed by automatic semicolon insertion, because the
parenthesized expression that begins the second line can be interpreted
as an argument list for a function call:

a = b + c(d + e).print()

In the circumstance that an assignment statement must begin with a left
parenthesis, it is a good idea for the programmer to provide an explicit
semicolon at the end of the preceding statement rather than to rely on
automatic semicolon insertion.

    GeneratorExpression.

Identifier :: IdentifierName BUT NOT ReservedWord

-   It is a Syntax Error if this production is contained in strict code
    and the StringValue of IdentifierName is: "IMPLEMENTS",
    "INTERFACE", "LET", "PACKAGE", "PRIVATE", "PROTECTED", "PUBLIC", or
    "STATIC".

-   It is a Syntax Error if this production is contained in strict code
    and the StringValue of IdentifierName is "YIELD".

-   It is a Syntax Error if StringValue of IdentifierName is the same
    string value as the StringValue of any ReservedWord except for
    YIELD.

NOTE StringValue of IdentifierName normalizes any Unicode escape
sequences in IdentifierName hence such escapes cannot be used to write
an Identifier whose code point sequence is the same as a
ReservedWord.

NOTE UNDEFINED is passed for environment to indicate that a PutValue
operation should be used to assign the initialization value. This is the
case for VAR statements and formal parameter lists of some non-strict
functions (See 9.2.13). In those cases a lexical binding is hoisted and
preinitialized prior to evaluation of its initializer.

    b.  Return PutValue(lhs, value).

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

IdentifierReference : Identifier

1.  Return ResolveBinding(StringValue(Identifier)).

IdentifierReference : YIELD

1.  Return ResolveBinding("YIELD").

NOTE 1: The result of evaluating an IdentifierReference is always a
value of type Reference.

NOTE 2: In non-strict code, the keyword YIELD may be used as an
identifier. Evaluating the IdentifierReference production resolves the
binding of YIELD as if it was an Identifier. Early Error restriction
ensures that such an evaluation only can occur for non-strict code. See
13.2.1 for the handling of YIELD in binding creation contexts.

Array Literal

NOTE An ArrayLiteral is an expression describing the initialization of
an Array object, using a list, of zero or more expressions each of which
represents an array element, enclosed in square brackets. The elements
need not be literals; they are evaluated each time the array initializer
is evaluated.

Array elements may be elided at the beginning, middle or end of the
element list. Whenever a comma in the element list is not preceded by an
AssignmentExpression (i.e., a comma at the beginning or after another
comma), the missing array element contributes to the length of the Array
and increases the index of subsequent elements. Elided array elements
are not defined. If an element is elided at the end of an array, that
element does not contribute to the length of the Array.

Object Initializer

NOTE 1 An object initializer is an expression describing the
initialization of an Object, written in a form resembling a literal. It
is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values,
enclosed in curly braces. The values need not be literals; they are
evaluated each time the object initializer is evaluated.

NOTE 2 MethodDefinition is defined in 14.3.

NOTE 3 In certain contexts, ObjectLiteral is used as a cover grammar
for a more restricted secondary grammar. The CoverInitializedName
production is necessary to fully cover these secondary grammars.
However, use of this production results in an early Syntax Error in
normal contexts where an actual ObjectLiteral is expected.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

In addition to describing an actual object initializer the
ObjectLiteral productions are also used as a cover grammar for
ObjectAssignmentPattern (12.14.5). and may be recognized as part of a
CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList. When
ObjectLiteral appears in a context where ObjectAssignmentPattern is
required the following Early Error rules are NOT applied. In addition,
they are not applied when initially parsing a
CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList.

-   1.  2.

Generator Comprehensions

Syntax

GeneratorComprehension~[Yield]~ :

( Comprehension~[?Yield]~ )

NOTE The keyword YIELD may be used in IdentifierReference contexts
within a GeneratorComprehension contained in non-strict code. The
following early error rule ensures that a GeneratorComprehension never
contains a YieldExpression.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

GeneratorComprehension : ( Comprehension )

-   It is a Syntax Error if Comprehension Contains YieldExpression
    is TRUE.

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

GeneratorComprehension : ( Comprehension )

1.  If GeneratorComprehension is contained in strict mode code, then
    let strict be TRUE; otherwise let strict be FALSE.

2.  Let scope be the LexicalEnvironment of the running execution
    context.

3.  Let parameters be the production: FormalParameters : [empty].

4.  Using Comprehension from the production that is being evaluated,
    let body be the supplemental syntactic grammar production:
    GeneratorBody : Comprehension.

5.  Let closure be GeneratorFunctionCreate(Arrow, parameters, _body,
    scope_, strict).

6.  Let prototype be ObjectCreate(%GeneratorPrototype%).

7.  Perform MakeConstructor(closure, TRUE, and prototype).

8.  Let iterator be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method
    of closure with UNDEFINED as thisArgument and an empty List as
    argumentsList.

9.  Return iterator.

NOTE The GeneratorFunction object created in step 5 is not observable
from ECMAScript code so an implementation may choose to avoid its
allocation and initialization. In that case, other semantically
equivalent means must be used to allocate and initialize the iterator
object in step 8. In either case, the prototype object created in step
6 must be created because it is potentially observable as the value of
the iterator object’s [[Prototype]] internal slot. If strict is
FALSE and the Comprehesion contains any direct eval calls then any
VarScopedDeclaration bindings created by the evals are created in the
VariableEnvironment of the function called in step 8.

Regular Expression Literals

Syntax

See 11.8.4.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

PrimaryExpression : RegularExpressionLiteral

-   It is a Syntax Error if BodyText of RegularExpressionLiteral

-   It is a Syntax Error if FlagText of RegularExpressionLiteral
    contains any code points other than "G", "I", "M", "U", or "Y", or
    if it contains the same code point more than once.

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

PrimaryExpression : RegularExpressionLiteral

1.  Let pattern be the string value consisting of the UTF-16Encoding
    of each code point of BodyText of RegularExpressionLiteral.

2.  Let flags be the string value consisting of the UTF-16Encoding of

    elements is firstSub, and whose subsequent elements are the
    elements of restSub, in order. restSub may contain no elements.

Runtime Semantics: GetTemplateCallSite 

The abstract operation GetTemplateCallSite is called with a grammar
production, templateLiteral, as an argument. It performs the following
steps:

1.  If a call site object for the source code corresponding to
    templateLiteral has already been created (see step 12 below) by a
    previous call to this abstract operation, then

    a.  Return that call site object.

2.  Let cookedStrings be TemplateStrings of templateLiteral with

        cookedValue, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE, [[Writable]]: FALSE,
        [[Configurable]]: FALSE}.

    d.  Let rawValue be the string value at 0-based position index
        of the List rawStrings.

10. Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of siteObj with
    arguments "RAW" and PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: rawObj,

11. Perform SetIntegrityLevel(siteObj, "FROZEN").

12. Remember an association between the source code corresponding to
    templateLiteral and siteObj such that siteObj can be retrieve
    in subsequent calls to this abstract operation.

13. Return siteObj.

NOTE 1 The creation of a call site object cannot result in an abrupt
completion.

NOTE 2 Each TemplateLiteral in the program code is associated with a
unique Template call site object that is used in the evaluation of
tagged Templates (12.2.9.2.4). The call site objects are frozen and the
same call site object is used each time a specific tagged Template is
evaluated. Whether call site objects are created lazily upon first
evaluation of the TemplateLiteral or eagerly prior to first evaluation
is an implementation choice that is not observable to ECMAScript code.

NOTE 3 Future editions of this specification may define additional
non-enumerable properties of call site objects.

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

The production MultiplicativeExpression : _MultiplicativeExpression @
UnaryExpression_, where @ stands for one of the operators in the above
definitions, is evaluated as follows:

1.  Let left be the result of evaluating MultiplicativeExpression.

2.  Let leftValue be GetValue(left).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(leftValue).

4.  Let right be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.

5.  Let rightValue be GetValue(right).

6.  Let lnum be ToNumber(leftValue).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(lnum).

8.  Let rnum be ToNumber(rightValue).

9.  ReturnIfAbrupt(rnum).

10. Return the result of applying the specified operation (*, /, or %)
    to lnum and rnum. See the Notes below 12.6.3.1, 12.6.3.2,
    12.6.3.3.

Applying the * Operator

The * operator performs multiplication, producing the product of its
operands. Multiplication is commutative. Multiplication is not always
associative in ECMAScript, because of finite precision.

The result of a floating-point multiplication is governed by the rules
of IEEE 754 binary double-precision arithmetic:

-   If either operand is NAN, the result is NAN.

-   The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same
      sign, negative if the operands have different signs.

-   Multiplication of an infinity by a zero results in NAN.

-   Multiplication of an infinity by an infinity results in an infinity.
      The sign is determined by the rule already stated above.

-   Multiplication of an infinity by a finite nonzero value results in a
      signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
      above.

-   In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity nor NaN is
      involved, the product is computed and rounded to the nearest
      representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode. If the
      magnitude is too large to represent, the result is then an
      infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to
      represent, the result is then a zero of appropriate sign. The
      ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as
      defined by IEEE 754.

Applying the / Operator

The / operator performs division, producing the quotient of its
operands. The left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the
divisor. ECMAScript does not perform integer division. The operands and
result of all division operations are double-precision floating-point
numbers. The result of division is determined by the specification of
IEEE 754 arithmetic:

-   If either operand is NAN, the result is NAN.

-   The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same
      sign, negative if the operands have different signs.

-   Division of an infinity by an infinity results in NAN.

-   Division of an infinity by a zero results in an infinity. The sign
      is determined by the rule already stated above.

-   Division of an infinity by a nonzero finite value results in a
      signed infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already stated
      above.

-   Division of a finite value by an infinity results in zero. The sign
      is determined by the rule already stated above.

-   Division of a zero by a zero results in NAN; division of zero by any
      other finite value results in zero, with the sign determined by
      the rule already stated above.

-   Division of a nonzero finite value by a zero results in a signed
      infinity. The sign is determined by the rule already stated above.

-   In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor
      NAN is involved, the quotient is computed and rounded to the
      nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode.
      If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation
      overflows; the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If
      the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows
      and the result is a zero of the appropriate sign. The ECMAScript
      language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE
      754.

Applying the % Operator

The % operator yields the remainder of its operands from an implied
division; the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the
divisor.

NOTE In C and C++, the remainder operator accepts only integral
operands; in ECMAScript, it also accepts floating-point operands.

The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the %
operator is not the same as the “remainder” operation defined by IEEE
754. The IEEE 754 “remainder” operation computes the remainder from a
rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its behaviour is
not analogous to that of the usual integer remainder operator. Instead
the ECMAScript language defines % on floating-point operations to behave
in a manner analogous to that of the Java integer remainder operator;
this may be compared with the C library function fmod.

The result of an ECMAScript floating-point remainder operation is
determined by the rules of IEEE arithmetic:

-   If either operand is NAN, the result is NAN.

-   The sign of the result equals the sign of the dividend.

-   If the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both,
      the result is NAN.

-   If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the result
      equals the dividend.

-   If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is nonzero and finite, the
      result is the same as the dividend.

-   In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor
      NAN is involved, the floating-point remainder r from a dividend n
      and a divisor d is defined by the mathematical relation r = n − (d
      × q) where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is
      negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose magnitude
      is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the
      true mathematical quotient of n and d. r is computed and rounded
      to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest
      mode.

as if the hint String were given. Exotic objects may handle the absence
of a hint in some other manner.

algorithm (7.2.8), by using the logical-or operation instead of the
logical-and operation.

Applying the Additive Operators to Numbers

The + operator performs addition when applied to two operands of numeric
type, producing the sum of the operands. The - operator performs
subtraction, producing the difference of two numeric operands.

Addition is a commutative operation, but not always associative.

The result of an addition is determined using the rules of IEEE 754
binary double-precision arithmetic:

-   If either operand is NAN, the result is NAN.

-   The sum of two infinities of opposite sign is NAN.

-   The sum of two infinities of the same sign is the infinity of that
      sign.

-   The sum of an infinity and a finite value is equal to the infinite
      operand.

-   The sum of two negative zeroes is −0. The sum of two positive
      zeroes, or of two zeroes of opposite sign, is +0.

-   The sum of a zero and a nonzero finite value is equal to the nonzero
      operand.

-   The sum of two nonzero finite values of the same magnitude and
      opposite sign is +0.

-   In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor
      NaN is involved, and the operands have the same sign or have
      different magnitudes, the sum is computed and rounded to the
      nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode.
      If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation
      overflows and the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign.
      The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as
      defined by IEEE 754.

NOTE The - operator performs subtraction when applied to two operands of
numeric type, producing the difference of its operands; the left operand
is the minuend and the right operand is the subtrahend. Given numeric
operands a and b, it is always the case that a–b produces the same
result as _a +(–b)_.

Runtime Semantics: InstanceofOperator(O, C)

The abstract operation InstanceofOperator(O, C) implements the
generic algorithm for determining if an object O inherits from the

5.  If IsCallable(C) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  Return OrdinaryHasInstance(C, O).

NOTE Steps 5 and 6 provide compatibility with previous editions of
ECMAScript that did not use a @@hasInstance method to define the
INSTANCEOF operator semantics. If a function object does not define or
inherit @@hasInstance it uses the default INSTANCEOF semantics.

7.  Let r be the result of performing Strict Equality Comparison
    rval === lval.

8.  If r is TRUE, return FALSE. Otherwise, return TRUE.

NOTE 1 Given the above definition of equality:

-   String comparison can be forced by: "" + A == "" + B.

-   Numeric comparison can be forced by: +A == +B.

-   Boolean comparison can be forced by: !A == !B.

NOTE 2 The equality operators maintain the following invariants:

-   A != B is equivalent to !(A == B).

-   A == B is equivalent to B == A, except in the order of evaluation of
      A and B.

NOTE 3 The equality operator is not always transitive. For example,
there might be two distinct String objects, each representing the same
String value; each String object would be considered equal to the String
value by the == operator, but the two String objects would not be equal
to each other. For Example:

-   NEW STRING("A") == "A" and "A" == NEW STRING("A")are both TRUE.

-   NEW STRING("A") == NEW STRING("A") is FALSE.

NOTE 4 Comparison of Strings uses a simple equality test on sequences of
code unit values. There is no attempt to use the more complex,
semantically oriented definitions of character or string equality and
collating order defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore Strings
values that are canonically equal according to the Unicode standard
could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes that both
Strings are already in normalized form.

NOTE The grammar for a ConditionalExpression in ECMAScript is slightly
different from that in C and Java, which each allow the second
subexpression to be an Expression but restrict the third expression to
be a ConditionalExpression. The motivation for this difference in
ECMAScript is to allow an assignment expression to be governed by either
arm of a conditional and to eliminate the confusing and fairly useless
case of a comma expression as the centre expression.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

AssignmentExpression : LeftHandSideExpression =
AssignmentExpression

-   It is a Syntax Error if LeftHandSideExpression is either an
    ObjectLiteral or an ArrayLiteral and the lexical token sequence
    matched by LeftHandSideExpression cannot be parsed with no tokens
    left over using AssignmentPattern as the goal symbol.

-   If LeftHandSideExpression is either an ObjectLiteral or an
    ArrayLiteral and if the lexical token sequence matched by
    LeftHandSideExpression can be parsed with no tokens left over
    using AssignmentPattern as the goal symbol then the following
    rules are not applied. Instead, the Early Error rules for
    AssignmentPattern are used.

-   It is a Syntax Error if LeftHandSideExpression is an
    IdentifierReference that can be statically determined to always
    resolve to a declarative environment record binding and the resolved
    binding is an immutable binding.

-   It is an early Reference Error if LeftHandSideExpression is
    neither an ObjectLiteral nor an ArrayLiteral and
    IsValidSimpleAssignmentTarget of LeftHandSideExpression is FALSE.

-   It is a Syntax Error if IdentifierReference statically resolves to
    a immutable binding.

AssignmentRestElement : ... DestructuringAssignmentTarget

-   It is a Syntax Error if IsValidSimpleAssignmentTarget of

DestructuringAssignmentTarget : LeftHandSideExpression

-   It is a Syntax Error if LeftHandSideExpression is either an
    ObjectLiteral or an ArrayLiteral and if the lexical token
    sequence matched by LeftHandSideExpression cannot be parsed with
    no tokens left over using AssignmentPattern as the goal symbol.

-   It is a Syntax Error if LeftHandSideExpression is neither an

scoped variable, constant, function, generator function, or class
declarated in the block are instantiated in the environment record.

Declarations and the Variable Statement

Let and Const Declarations

NOTE LET and CONST declarations define variables that are scoped to the
running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment. The variables are
created when their containing Lexical Environment is instantiated but
may not be accessed in any way until the variable’s LexicalBinding is
evaluated. A variable defined by a LexicalBinding with an
Initializer is assigned the value of its Initializer’s
AssignmentExpression when the LexicalBinding is evaluated, not when
the variable is created. If a LexicalBinding in a LET declaration does
not have an Initializer the variable is assigned the value UNDEFINED
when the LexicalBinding is evaluated.

Syntax

LexicalDeclaration~[In,\ Yield]~ :

LetOrConst BindingList~[?In,\ ?Yield]~ ;

LetOrConst :

Static Semantics: Early Errors

LexicalDeclaration : LetOrConst BindingList ;

-   It is a Syntax Error if the BoundNames of BindingList contains
    "LET".

-   It is a Syntax Error if the BoundNames of BindingList contains any
    duplicate entries.

LexicalBinding : BindingIdentifier Initializer~opt~

    IsConstantDeclaration of the LexicalDeclaration containing this
    production is TRUE.

LexicalBinding : BindingIdentifier

1.  Let env be the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment.

2.  Let value be GetValue(rhs).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(value).

Variable Statement

NOTE A VAR statement declares variables that are scoped to the running
execution context’s VariableEnvironment. Var variables are created when
their containing Lexical Environment is instantiated and are initialized
to UNDEFINED when created. Within the scope of any VariableEnvironemnt a
common Identifier may appear in more than one VariableDeclaration
but those declarations collective define only one variable. A variable
defined by a VariableDeclaration with an Initializer is assigned the
value of its Initializer’s AssignmentExpression when the
VariableDeclaration is executed, not when the variable is created.

Runtime Semantics: BindingInitialization

  With arguments value and environment.

See also: 12.1.4, 12.2.4.2.2, 13.2.3.5, 13.14.4.

NOTE UNDEFINED is passed for environment to indicate that a PutValue
operation should be used to assign the initialization value. This is the
case for VAR statements and the formal parameter lists of some
non-strict functions (see 9.2.13). In those cases a lexical binding is
hoisted and preinitialized prior to evaluation of its initializer.

VariableDeclaration : BindingIdentifier

1.  Return the result of performing BindingInitialization for
    BindingIdentifier passing value and UNDEFINED as the arguments.

VariableDeclaration : BindingIdentifier Initializer

1.  Return the result of performing BindingInitialization for

    a.  Let hasNameProperty be HasOwnProperty(value, "NAME").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(hasNameProperty).

    c.  If hasNameProperty is FALSE, then

        i.  Perform SetFunctionName(value,
            StringValue(BindingIdentifier)).

        ii. Assert: SetFunctionName will not return an abrupt
            completion.

5.  Return the result of performing BindingInitialization for
    BindingIdentifier passing value and UNDEFINED as the arguments.

NOTE If a VariableDeclaration is nested within a with statement and
the Identifier in the VariableDeclaration is the same as a property
name of the binding object of the with statement’s object environment
record, then step 5 will assign value to the property instead of
assigning to the VariableEnvironment binding of the Identifier.

VariableDeclaration : BindingPattern Initializer

1.  Let rhs be the result of evaluating Initializer.

2.  Let rval be GetValue(rhs).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(rval).

4.  If Type(rval) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

-   It is a Syntax Error if this production is not nested, directly or
    indirectly (but not crossing function boundaries), within an
    IterationStatement.

ContinueStatement : CONTINUE LabelIdentifier ;

-   It is a Syntax Error if this production is not nested, directly or
    indirectly (but not crossing function boundaries), within an
    IterationStatement.

-   It is a Syntax Error if StringValue(LabelIdentifier) does not
    appear in the enclosing IterationLabelSet of this
    ContinueStatement.

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

ContinueStatement : CONTINUE ;

1.  Return Completion{[[type]]: continue, [[value]]: empty, [[target]]:
    empty}.

a value to the caller. If Expression is omitted, the return value is
UNDEFINED. Otherwise, the return value is the value of Expression.

Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

ReturnStatement : RETURN ;

1.  Return Completion{[[type]]: return, [[value]]: UNDEFINED,

Syntax

WithStatement~[Yield,\ Return]~ :

WITH ( Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ) Statement~[?Yield,\ ?Return]~

NOTE The WITH statement adds an object environment record for a computed
object to the lexical environment of the running execution context. It
then executes a statement using this augmented lexical environment.
Finally, it restores the original lexical environment.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

WithStatement : WITH ( Expression ) Statement

-   It is a Syntax Error if the code that matches this production is
    contained in strict code.

Labelled Statements

Syntax

LabelledStatement~[Yield,\ Return]~ :

LabelIdentifier~[?Yield]~ : LabelledItem~[?Yield,\ ?Return]~

LabelledItem~[Yield,\ Return]~ :

Statement~[?Yield,\ ?Return]
~FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~

NOTE A Statement may be prefixed by a label. Labelled statements are
only used in conjunction with labelled BREAK and CONTINUE statements.
ECMAScript has no GOTO statement. A Statement can be part of a
LabelledStatement, which itself can be part of a LabelledStatement,
and so on. The labels introduced this way are collectively referred to
as the “current label set” when describing the semantics of individual
statements. A LabelledStatement has no semantic meaning other than the
introduction of a label to a _label set_.

Static Semantics: Early Errors

LabelledStatement : LabelIdentifier : LabelledItem

-   It is a Syntax Error if the immediately enclosing CurrentLabelSet
    contains the StringValue of LabelIdentifier.

LabelledItem : FunctionDeclaration

-   It is a Syntax Error if any source code matches this rule.

NOTE An alternative definition for this rule is provided in B.3.2.

Static Semantics: CurrentLabelSet

LabelledStatement : LabelIdentifier : LabelledItem

1.  The CurrentLabelSet of this LabelledStatement is a List that
    includes the StringValue of LabelIdentifier and all elements of
    the immediately enclosing CurrentLabelSet.

Static Semantics: IsLabelledFunction ( stmt )

The abstract operation IsLabelledFunction with argument stmt performs
the following steps:

1.  If stmt is not a a LabelledStatement, then return FALSE.

2.  Let item be the LabelledItem compoenent of stmt.

3.  If item is LabeledItem : FunctionDeclaration, then return
    TRUE.

Finally~[Yield,\ Return]~ :

FINALLY Block~[?Yield,\ ?Return]~

CatchParameter~[Yield]~ :

BindingIdentifier~[?Yield]

CATCH clause provides the exception-handling code. When a catch clause
catches an exception, its CatchParameter is bound to that exception.

Runtime Semantics: BindingInitialization

  With arguments value and environment.

NOTE UNDEFINED is passed for environment to indicate that a PutValue
operation should be used to assign the initialization value. This is the
case for VAR statements and the formal parameter lists of some
non-strict functions (see 9.2.13). In those cases a lexical binding is
hoisted and preinitialized prior to evaluation of its initializer.

See also: 12.1.4, 12.2.4.2.2, 13.2.2.4, 13.2.3.5.

Directive Prologues and the Use Strict Directive

A Directive Prologue is the longest sequence of ExpressionStatement
productions occurring as the initial StatementListItem productions of
a FunctionBody or a ScriptBody and where each ExpressionStatement
in the sequence consists entirely of a StringLiteral token followed by
a semicolon. The semicolon may appear explicitly or may be inserted by
automatic semicolon insertion. A Directive Prologue may be an empty
sequence.

A Use Strict Directive is an ExpressionStatement in a Directive
Prologue whose StringLiteral is either the exact code unit sequences
"USE STRICT" or 'USE STRICT'. A Use Strict Directive may not contain an
EscapeSequence or LineContinuation.

A Directive Prologue may contain more than one Use Strict Directive.
However, an implementation may issue a warning if this occurs.

NOTE The ExpressionStatement productions of a Directive Prologue are
evaluated normally during evaluation of the containing production.
Implementations may define implementation specific meanings for
ExpressionStatement productions which are not a Use Strict Directive
and which occur in a Directive Prologue. If an appropriate notification
mechanism exists, an implementation should issue a warning if it
encounters in a Directive Prologue an ExpressionStatement that is not
a Use Strict Directive and which does not have a meaning defined by the
implementation.

    Syntax Error if BindingIdentifier is the the IdentifierName EVAL
    or the IdentifierName ARGUMENTS.

-   -   It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of
    FormalParameters also occurs in the LexicallyDeclaredNames of
    FunctionBody.

NOTE The LexicallyDeclaredNames of a FunctionBody does not include
identifiers bound using var or function declarations.

StrictFormalParameters : FormalParameters

-   It is a Syntax Error if BoundNames of FormalParameters contains

FunctionExpression.

NOTE 2 A PROTOTYPE property is automatically created for every function
defined using a FunctionDeclaration or FunctionExpression, to allow
for the possibility that the function will be used as a constructor.

NOTE Any reference to ARGUMENTS, SUPER, or THIS within an
ArrowFunction are resoved to their bindings in the lexically enclosing
function. Even though an ArrowFunction may contain references to
SUPER, the function object created in step 4 is not made into a method
by performing MakeMethod. An ArrowFunction that references SUPER is
always contained within a non-ArrowFunction and the necessary state to
implement SUPER is accessible via the scope that is captured by the
function object of the ArrowFunction.

Runtime Semantics: PrepareForTailCall ( )

The abstract operation PrepareForTailCall performs the following steps:

1.  Let leafContext be the running execution context.

2.  Suspend leafContext.

3.  Pop leafContext from the execution context context stack. The
    execution context now on the top of the stack becomes the running
    execution context.

4.  Assert: leafContext has no further use. It will never be activated
    as the running execution context.

A tail position call must either release any transient internal
resources associated with the currently executing function execution
context before invoking the target function or reuse those resources in
support of the target function.

NOTE 1 For example, a tail position call should only grow an
implementation’s activation record stack by the amount that the size of
the target function’s activation record exceeds the size of the calling
function’s activation record. If the target function’s activation record
is smaller, then the total size of the stack should decrease.

Script : ScriptBody~opt~

1.  The code of this Script is strict mode code if the Directive
    Prologue (14.1.1) of its ScriptBody contains a Use Strict
    Directive or if any of the conditions of 10.2.1 apply. If the code
    of this Script is strict mode code, ScriptBody is evaluated in
    the following steps as strict mode code. Otherwise ScriptBody is
    evaluated in the following steps as non-strict mode code.

2.  If ScriptBody is not present, return NormalCompletion(empty).

14. Suspend scriptCxt and remove it from the execution context stack.

15. Assert: the execution context stack is not empty.

16. Resume the context that is now on the top of the execution context
    stack as the running execution context.

17. Return result.

NOTE The processes for initiating the evaluation of a Script and for
dealing with the result of such an evaluation are defined by an
ECMAScript implementation and not by this specification.

Runtime Semantics: GlobalDeclarationInstantiation

NOTE When an execution context is established for evaluating scripts,
declarations are instantiated in the current global environment. Each
global binding declared in the code is instantiated.

GlobalDeclarationInstantiation is performed as follows using arguments
script, env, and deletableBindings. script is the ScriptBody
that for which the execution context is being established. env is the
global environment record in which bindings are to be created.
deletableBindings is TRUE if the bindings that are created should be
deletable.

1.  Let strict be IsStrict of script.

2.  Let lexNames be the LexicallyDeclaredNames of script.

3.  Let varNames be the VarDeclaredNames of script.

4.  For each name in lexNames, do

    a.  If the result of calling env’s HasVarDeclaration concrete
        method passing name as the argument is TRUE, throw a
        SYNTAXERROR exception.

    b.  If the result of calling env’s HasLexicalDeclaration concrete
        method passing name as the argument is TRUE, throw a
        SYNTAXERROR exception.

5.  For each name in varNames, do

    a.  If the result of calling env’s HasLexicalDeclaration concrete
        method passing name as the argument is TRUE, throw a
        SYNTAXERROR exception.

6.  Let varDeclarations be the VarScopedDeclarations of script.

7.  Let functionsToInitialize be an empty List.

8.  Let declaredFunctionNames be an empty List.

9.  For each d in varDeclarations, in reverse list order do

    a.  If d is neither a VariableDeclaration or a ForBinding,
        then

        i.  Assert: d is either a FunctionDeclaration or a
            GeneratorDeclaration.

        ii. NOTE If there are multiple FunctionDeclarations for the
            same name, the last declaration is used.

        iii. Let fn be the sole element of the BoundNames of d.

        iv. If fn is not an element of declaredFunctionNames, then

            1.  Let fnDefinable be the result of calling env’s
                CanDeclareGlobalFunction concrete method passing fn as
                the argument.

            2.  If fnDefinable is FALSE, throw TYPEERROR exception.

            3.  Append fn to declaredFunctionNames.

            4.  Insert d as the first element of
                functionsToInitialize.

10. Let declaredVarNames be an empty List.

11. For each d in varDeclarations, do

    a.  If d is a VariableDeclaration or a ForBinding then

        i.  For each String vn in the BoundNames of d, do

            1.  If vn is not an element of declaredFunctionNames,
                then

                a.  Let vnDefinable be the result of calling env’s
                    CanDeclareGlobalVar concrete method passing vn as
                    the argument.

                b.  If vnDefinable is FALSE, throw TYPEERROR
                    exception.

                c.  If vn is not an element of declaredVarNames,
                    then

                    i.  Append vn to declaredVarNames.

12. NOTE: No abnormal terminations occur after this algorithm step if
    the global object is an ordinary object. However, if the global
    object is a Proxy exotic object it may exhibit behaviours that cause
    abnormal terminations in some of the following steps.

13. Let lexDeclarations be the LexicallyScopedDeclarations of
    script.

14. For each element d in lexDeclarations do

    a.  NOTE Lexically declarated names are only instantiated here but
        not initialized.

    b.  For each element dn of the BoundNames of d do

        i.  If IsConstantDeclaration of d is TRUE, then

            1.  Let status be the result of calling env’s
                CreateImmutableBinding concrete method passing dn as
                the argument.

        ii. Else,

            1.  Let status be the result of calling env’s
                CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing dn and
                FALSE as the arguments.

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

15. For each production f in functionsToInitialize, do

    a.  Let fn be the sole element of the BoundNames of f.

    b.  Let fo be the result of performing InstantiateFunctionObject
        for f with argument env.

    c.  Let status be the result of calling env’s
        CreateGlobalFunctionBinding concrete method passing fn, fo,
        and deletableBindings as the arguments.

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

16. For each String vn in declaredVarNames, in list order do

    a.  Let status be the result of calling env’s
        CreateGlobalVarBinding concrete method passing vn and
        deletableBindings as the argument.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

17. 18. a.  b.  i.  1.  

        ii. 1.  

        iii. 

    c.  i.  ii. iii. iv. 

19. Return NormalCompletion(empty)

NOTE Early errors specified in 15.1.1 prevent name conflicts between
function/var declarations and let/const/class declarations as well as
redeclaration of let/const/class bindings for declaration contained
within a single Script. However, such conflicts and redeclarations
that span more than one Script are detected as runtime errors during
GlobalDeclarationInstantiation. If any such errors are detected, no
bindings are instantiated for the script. However, if the global object
is defined using Proxy exotic objects then the runtime tests for
conflicting declarations may be unreliable resulting in an abrupt
completion and some global declarations not being instantiated. If this
occurs, the code for the Script is not evaluated.

Unlike explicit var or function declarations, properties that are
directly created on the global object result in global bindings that may
be shadowed by let/const/class declarations.

Runtime Semantics: ScriptEvaluationJob ( source )

The job ScriptEvaluationJob with parameter source parses, validates,
and evaluates the Script represented by source.

1.  Assert: source is a SourceCharacter sequence (see 10).

2.  3.  Parse source using Script as the goal symbol and analyze the
    parse result for any Early Error conditions. If the parse was
    successful and no early errors were found, then let script the
    resulting parse tree. Otherwise, let script be an indication of
    one or more parsing errors and/or early errors. Parsing and early
    error detection may be interweaved in an implementation dependent
    manner. If more than one parse or early error is present, the number
    and ordering of reported errors is implementation dependent but at
    least one error must be reported.

4.  If script is an error indication, then

    a.  Report or log the error(s) in an implementation dependent
        manner.

    b.  Let status be NormalCompletion(UNDEFINED).

5.  Else,

    a.  b.  c.  d.  Let realm be the running execution context’s
        Realm.

    e.  Let status be the result of ScriptEvaluation of script with
        arguments realm and FALSE.

6.  NextJob status.

NOTE An implementation may parse a Script and analyze it for Early
Error conditions prior to the execution of the ScriptEvaluationJob for
that Script. However, the reporting of any errors must be deferred
until the ScriptEvaluationJob is actually executed.

Runtime Semantics: Module Objects

ModuleImport : MODULE _ImportedBinding FromClause_ ;

An ModuleImport imports a module and introduces a single binding
within the containing module environment. The value of such a binding as
a Module object.

A Module object is an exotic object whose own properties corresponding
corresponding to the ExportedBindings of the module identifed by the
ModuleImport FromClause. Each property name is the StringValue of
the corresponding exported binding. These are the only properties of an
Module object. Each one is a read-only property with attributes
{[[Configurable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE}. Module objects are not
extensible.

TO DO

Needs to decide whether a module object is an ordinary or an exotic
object. Whether properties are accessor or defined via [[Get]], etc.

Runtime Semantics: Loader State

Loader Records and Loader Objects

Loader Records contain the state of a of distinct module loading
context. Each Loader Record has the fields defined in Table 35. Loader
objects (26.3) are ECMAScript objects that permit ECMAScript code to
define and manage module loading contexts.

Table 35 — Loader Record Fields

  [[Modules]]    List of                                                                                      Normalized names bound to fully linked Module records. The list can contain modules whose code has not yet been evaluated. However, except for the case of cyclic imports, such modules are not exposed to user code.

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CreateLoaderRecord(realm, object) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CreateLoaderRecord creates and returns a new
Loader Record. The argument realm is the Realm record that will be
associated with Loader. The argument object is the either UNDEFINED or
the Loader object that will reflect this Loader record.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let loader be a new Loader Record.

2.  Set loader.[[Realm]] to realm.

3.  Set loader.[[Modules]] to a new empty List.

4.  Set loader.[[Loads]] to a new empty List.

5.  Set loader.[[LoaderObj]] to object.

6.  Return loader.

Load Records and LoadRequest Objects

The Load Record represents an attempt to locate, fetch, translate, and
parse a single module.

Each Load Record has the fields defined in Table 36:

Table 36 — Load Record Fields

  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_       _VALUE TYPE_                                       MEANING
  [[Status]]         One of: "LOADING", "LOADED", "LINKED", "FAILED".   The current state of this Load request.
  [[Name]]           String | UNDEFINED                                 The normalized name of the module being loaded, or UNDEFINED if loading an anonymous module.
  [[LinkSets]]       List of LinkSet Record                             A List of all LinkSets that require this Load request to succeed. There is a many-to-many relation between Load records and LinkSets. A single IMPORT() call can have a large dependency tree, involving many Load records. Many IMPORT() calls, if they depend on the same module, can be waiting for a single Load to complete.
  [[Metadata]]       Object                                             An object passed to each loader hook which hooks may use for any purpose.
  [[Address]]        Object | UNDEFINED                                 The result of the locate hook.
  [[Source]]         String | UNDEFINED                                 The result of the translate hook.
  [[Kind]]           One of: UNDEFINED, dynamic, declarative            Once the Load reaches the "LOADED" state, either declarative or dynamic. If the instantiate hook returned UNDEFINED, the module is declarative, and load.[[Body]] contains a Module parse. Otherwise, the instantiate hook returned a ModuleFactory object and [[Execute]] contains the .execute callable object.
  [[Body]]           UNDEFINED or a parse result                        If [[Kind]] is DECLARATIVE, the parse of a Module production. Otherwise UNDEFINED.
  [[Execute]]                                                           If [[Kind]] is DYNAMIC, the value of FACTORY.EXECUTE. Otherwise UNDEFINED.
  [[Dependencies]]   Undefined or List of Records                       If [[Status]] is not "LOADING", a List of pairs. Each pair consists of two strings: a module name as it appears in a module, import, or export from declaration in load.[[Body]], and the corresponding normalized module name.
  [[GroupIndex]]     Number                                             Largerest Dependency group count
  [[Exception]]                                                         If [[Status]] is "failed", the exception value that was thrown, causing the load to fail. Otherwise, null.
  [[Module]]                                                            The Module object produced by this load, or UNDEFINED.
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A LoadRequest object is an ordinary Object, inheriting from
OBJECT.PROTOTYPE with own data properties whose values corresponding
certain fields of a corresonding Load Record. A LoadRequest object is
created when the value of those fields need to be passed to an
ECMAScript function. Every LoadRequest object has NAME, and METADATA
properties corresponding to the [[Name]] and [[Metadata]] fields of a
Load Record. A LoadRequest object may also have ADDRESS and SOURCE
properties corresponding to the [[Address]] and [[Source]] fields of a
Load record.

CreateLoad(name) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CreateLoad creates and returns a new Load Record.
The argument name is either UNDEFINED, indicating an anonymous module,
or a normalized module name.

7.  Return load.

CreateLoadRequestObject(name, metadata, address, source) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CreateLoadRequestObject performed with arguments
name, metadata, and optional arguments address and source
returns a new LoadRequest Object. It performs the following steps:

1.  Let obj be ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%, ()).

2.  Assert: The following operations will never result in abrupt
    completions.

3.  Perform CreateDataProperty (obj, "NAME", name).

4.  Perform CreateDataProperty (obj, "METADATA", metadata).

5.  If address was passed, then perform CreateDataProperty (obj,
    "ADDRESS", address).

6.  If source was passed, then perform CreateDataProperty (obj,

    metadata, source, address).

RequestLoad(loader, request, refererName, refererAddress) Abstract Operation

The RequestLoad abstract operation normalizes the given module name,
request, and returns a Promise object that resolves to the value of a
Load object for the given module.

The loader argument is a Loader record.

request is the (non-normalized) name of the module to be imported, as
it appears in the import-declaration or as the argument to LOADER.LOAD()
or LOADER.IMPORT().

refererName and refererAddress provide information about the context
of the IMPORT() call or import-declaration. This information is passed
to all the loader hooks.

If the requested module is already in the loader's module registry,
RequestLoad returns a Promise object for a Load with the [[Status]]
field set to "LINKED". If the requested module is loading or loaded but
not yet linked, RequestLoad returns a Promise object for an existing
Load object from loader.[[Loads]]. Otherwise, RequestLoad starts
loading the module and returns a Promise object for a new Load Record.

The following steps are taken:

Module Linking Groups

A load record load~1~ has a _LINKAGE DEPENDENCY_ on a load record
load~2~ if load~2~ is contained in
load~1~.[[UnlinkedDependencies]] or there exists a load record load
in load~1~.[[UnlinkedDependencies]] such that load has a linkage
dependency on load~2~.

The _LINKAGE GRAPH_ of a List, list, of load records is the set of
load records load such that some load record in list has a linkage
dependency on load.

A _DEPENDENCY CHAIN_ from load~1~ to load~2~ is a List of load
records demonstrating the transitive linkage dependency from load~1~
to load~2~.

A _DEPENDENCY CYCLE_ is a dependency chain whose first and last
elements’ [[Name]] fields have the same value.

A dependency chain is CYCLIC if it contains a subsequence that is a
dependency cycle. A dependency chain is ACYCLIC if it is not cyclic.

A dependency chain is MIXED if there are two elements with distinct
values for their [[Kind]] fields. A _DEPENDENCY GROUP TRANSITION_ of
kind kind is a two-element subsequence load~1~, load~2~ of a
dependency chain such that load~1~.[[Kind]] is not equal to kind and
load~2~.[[Kind]] is equal to kind.

Runtime Semantics: Module Evaluation

Module bodies are evaluated on demand, as late as possible. The loader
uses the function ENSUREEVALUATED, defined below, to run scripts. The
loader always calls ENSUREEVALUATED before returning a Module object to
user code.

There is one way a module can be exposed to script before its body has
been evaluated. In the case of an import cycle, whichever module is
evaluated first can observe the others before they are evaluated. Simply
put, we have to start somewhere: one of the modules in the cycle must
run before the others.

EvaluateLoadedModule(load) Functions

An EvaluateLoadedModule function is an anonymous built-in function that
is used by REFLECT.LOADER.PROTOTYPE.MODULE and
REFLECT.LOADER.PROTOTYPE.IMPORT to ensure that a module has been
evaluated before it is passed to script code.

Each EvaluateLoadedModule function has a [[Loader]] internal slot.

When a EvaluateLoadedModule function F is called with argument load,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let loader be F.[[Loader]].

2.  Assert: load.[[Status]] is "LINKED".

3.  Let module be load.[[Module]].

4.  Let result be EnsureEvaluated(module, (), loader).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(result).

6.  Return module.

EnsureEvaluated(mod, seen, loader) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation EnsureEvaluated walks the dependency graph of the
module mod, evaluating any module bodies that have not already been
evaluated (including, finally, mod itself). Modules are evaluated in
depth-first, left-to-right, post order, stopping at cycles.

mod and its dependencies must already be linked.

The List seen is used to detect cycles. mod must not already be in
the List seen.

On success, mod and all its dependencies, transitively, will have
started to evaluate exactly once.

EnsureEvaluated performs the following steps:

1.  If mod.[[Evaluated]] is TRUE, return UNDEFINED.

2.  Append mod as the last element of seen.

3.  TODO: Create the module environment for mod

4.  Let deps be mod.[[Dependencies]].

5.  For each pair in deps, in List order,

    a.  Let dep be pair.[[value]].

    b.  If dep is not an element of seen, then

        i.  Call EnsureEvaluated with the arguments dep, seen, and
            loader.

6.  If mod.[[Evaluated]] is TRUE, return UNDEFINED.

7.  Set mod.[[Evaluated]] to TRUE.

8.  If mod.[[Body]] is UNDEFINED, then return UNDEFINED.

9.  Let status be ModuleDeclarationInstantiation(mod.[[Body]],
    mod.[[Environment]]).

10. Let initContext be a new ECMAScript code execution context.

11. Set initContext's Realm to loader.[[Realm]].

12. Set initContext's VariableEnvironment to mod.[[Environment]].

13. Set initContext's LexicalEnvironment to mod.[[Environment]].

14. If there is a currently running execution context, suspend it.

15. Push initContext on to the execution context stack; initContext
    is now the running execution context.

16. Let r be the result of evaluating mod.[[Body]].

17. Suspend initContext and remove it from the execution context
    stack.

18. Resume the context, if any, that is now on the top of the execution
    context stack as the running execution context.

19. Return r.



ERROR HANDLING AND LANGUAGE EXTENSIONS


An implementation must report most errors at the time the relevant
ECMAScript language construct is evaluated. An _early error_ is an error
that can be detected and reported prior to the evaluation of any
construct in the Script containing the error. The presense of an early
error prevents the evaluation of the construct. An implementation must
report early errors in a Script as part of the ScriptEvaluationJob for
that Script. Early errors in a Module are reported at the point when
the Module would be evaluated and the Module is never initialized.
Early errors in EVAL code are reported at the time EVAL is called and
prevent evaluation of the EVAL code. All errors that are not early
errors are runtime errors.

An implementation must report as an early error any occurrence of a
condition that is listed in a “Static Semantics: Early Errors” subclause
of this specification.

An implementation shall not treat other kinds of errors as early errors
even if the compiler can prove that a construct cannot execute without
error under any circumstances. An implementation may issue an early
warning in such a case, but it should not report the error until the
relevant construct is actually executed.

An implementation shall report all errors as specified, except for the
following:

-   An implementation may extend Script syntax, Module syntax, and
    regular expression pattern or flag syntax. To permit this, all
    operations (such as calling EVAL, using a regular expression
    literal, or using the FUNCTION or REGEXP constructor) that are
    allowed to throw SYNTAXERROR are permitted to exhibit
    implementation-defined behaviour instead of throwing SYNTAXERROR
    when they encounter an implementation-defined extension to the
    script syntax or regular expression pattern or flag syntax.

-   An implementation may provide additional types, values, objects,
    properties, and functions beyond those described in this
    specification. This may cause constructs (such as looking up a
    variable in the global scope) to have implementation-defined
    behaviour instead of throwing an error (such as REFERENCEERROR).

An implementation may define behaviour other than throwing RANGEERROR
for TOFIXED, TOEXPONENTIAL, and TOPRECISION when the fractionDigits or
precision argument is outside the specified range.



ECMASCRIPT STANDARD BUILT-IN OBJECTS 


There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript
Script begins execution. One, the global object, is part of the
lexical environment of the executing program. Others are accessible as
initial properties of the global object or indirectly as properties of
accessible built-in objects.

Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a
function is a Built-in Function object with the characteristics
described in 9.3. Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]]
internal slot of a built-in object initially has the value TRUE. Every
built-in Function object has a [[Realm]] internal slot whose value is
the code Realm for which the object was initially created.

Many built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments.
Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are functions intended
for use with the NEW operator. For each built-in function, this
specification describes the arguments required by that function and
properties of the Function object. For each built-in constructor, this
specification furthermore describes properties of the prototype object
of that constructor and properties of specific object instances returned
by a NEW expression that invokes that constructor.

Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function,
if a built-in function or constructor is given fewer arguments than the
function is specified to require, the function or constructor shall
behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient additional arguments,
each such argument being the UNDEFINED value. Such missing arguments are
considered to be “not present” and may be identified in that manner by
specification algorithms.

Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function,
if a built-in function or constructor described is given more arguments
than the function is specified to allow, the extra arguments are
evaluated by the call and then ignored by the function. However, an
implementation may define implementation specific behaviour relating to
such arguments as long as the behaviour is not the throwing of a
TYPEERROR exception that is predicated simply on the presence of an
extra argument.

NOTE Implementations that add additional capabilities to the set of
built-in functions are encouraged to do so by adding new functions
rather than adding new parameters to existing functions.

Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in
constructor has the Function prototype object, which is the initial
value of the expression FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE (19.2.3), as the value of its
[[Prototype]] internal slot.

Unless otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the
Object prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression
OBJECT.PROTOTYPE (19.1.3), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal
slot, except the Object prototype object itself.

Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not
implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified
in the description of a particular function.

Unless otherwise specified, every built-in function defined in clauses
18 through 26 are created as if by calling the CreateBuiltinFunction
abstract operation (9.3.1).

Every built-in Function object, including constructors, has a LENGTH
property whose value is an integer. Unless otherwise specified, this
value is equal to the largest number of named arguments shown in the
subclause headings for the function description, including optional
parameters. However, rest parameters shown using the form “...name” are
not included in the default argument count.

NOTE For example, the Function object that is the initial value of the
slice property of the String prototype object is described under the
subclause heading “String.prototype.slice (start, end)” which shows the
two named arguments start and end; therefore the value of the length
property of that Function object is 2.

Unless otherwise specified, the LENGTH property of a built-in Function
object has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Every built-in Function object, including constructors, that is not
identified as an anonymous function has a NAME property whose value is a
String. Unless otherwise specified, this value is the name that is given
to the function in this specification. For functions that are specified
as properties of objects, the name value is the property name string
used to access the function. Functions that are specified as get or set
accessor functions of built-in properties have "GET " or "SET "
prepended to the property name string. The value of the NAME property is
explicitly specified for each built-in functions whose property key is a
symbol value.

Unless otherwise specified, the NAME property of a built-in Function
object, if it exists, has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE,
[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Every other data property described in clauses 18 through 26 has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: TRUE } unless otherwise specified.

Every accessor property described in clauses 18 through 26 has the
attributes {[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE } unless
otherwise specified. If only a get accessor function is described, the
set accessor function is the default value, UNDEFINED. If only a set
accessor is function is described the get accessor is the default value,
UNDEFINED.



THE GLOBAL OBJECT 


The unique _global object_ is created before control enters any
execution context.

The global object does not have a [[Construct]] internal method; it is
not possible to use the global object as a constructor with the NEW
operator.

The global object does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not
possible to invoke the global object as a function.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the global object is
implementation-dependent.

In addition to the properties defined in this specification the global
object may have additional host defined properties. This may include a
property whose value is the global object itself; for example, in the
HTML document object model the WINDOW property of the global object is
the global object itself.


Value Properties of the Global Object

Infinity

The value of INFINITY is +∞ (see 6.1.6). This property has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

NaN

The value of NAN is NAN (see 6.1.6). This property has the attributes {
[[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

undefined

The value of UNDEFINED is UNDEFINED (see 6.1.1). This property has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: FALSE }.


Function Properties of the Global Object

eval (x)

When the EVAL function is called with one argument x, the following
steps are taken:

1.  If Type(x) is not String, return x.

2.  Let script be the ECMAScript code that is the result of parsing
    x, interpreted as UTF-16 encoded Unicode text as described in
    10.1.1, for the goal symbol Script. If the parse fails or any
    early errors are detected, throw a SYNTAXERROR exception (but see
    also clause 16).

3.  If script Contains ScriptBody is FALSE, return UNDEFINED.

4.  Let strictScript be IsStrict of script.

5.  If this is a direct call to eval (18.2.1.1), let direct be TRUE,
    otherwise let direct be FALSE.

6.  If direct is TRUE and the code that made the direct call to eval
    is strict code, then let strictCaller be TRUE. Otherwise, let
    strictCaller be FALSE.

7.  Let ctx be the running execution context. If direct is TRUE
    ctx will be the execution context that performed the direct eval.
    If direct is FALSE ctx will be the execution context for the
    invocation of the eval function.

8.  Let evalRealm be ctx’s Realm.

9.  If direct is FALSE and strictScript is FALSE, then

    a.  Return the result of ScriptEvaluation for script with
        arguments evalRealm and TRUE.

10. If direct is TRUE, strictScript is FALSE, strictCaller is
    FALSE, and ctx’s LexicalEnvironment is the same as
    evalRealm.[[globalEnv]], then

    a.  Return the result of ScriptEvaluation for script with
        arguments evalRealm and TRUE.

11. If direct is TRUE, then

    a.  If the code that made the direct call to eval is function code
        and ValidInFunction of script is FALSE, then throw a
        SYNTAXERROR exception.

    b.  If the code that made the direct call to eval is module code and
        ValidInModule of script is FALSE, then throw a SYNTAXERROR
        exception.

12. If direct is TRUE, then

    a.  Let lexEnv be ctx’s LexicalEnvironment.

    b.  Let varEnv be ctx’s VariableEnvironment.

13. Else,

    a.  Let lexEnv be evalRealm.[[globalEnv]].

    b.  Let varEnv be evalRealm.[[globalEnv]].

14. If strictScript is TRUE or if direct is TRUE and strictCaller
    is TRUE , then

    a.  Let strictVarEnv be NewDeclarativeEnvironment(lexEnv).

    b.  Let lexEnv be strictVarEnv.

    c.  Let varEnv be strictVarEnv.

15. Let status be the result of performing Eval Declaration
    Instantiation as described in 18.2.1.2 with script, varEnv, and
    lexEnv.

16. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

17. Let evalCxt be a new ECMAScript code execution context.

18. Set the evalCxt’s Realm to evalRealm.

19. Set the evalCxt’s VariableEnvironment to varEnv.

20. Set the evalCxt’s LexicalEnvironment to lexEnv.

21. If there is a currently running execution context, suspend it.

22. Push evalCxt on to the execution context stack; evalCxt is now
    the running execution context.

23. Let result be the result of evaluating script.

24. Suspend evalCxt and remove it from the execution context stack.

25. Resume the context that is now on the top of the execution context
    stack as the running execution context.

26. Return result.

NOTE The eval code cannot instantiate variable or function bindings in
the variable environment of the calling context that invoked the eval if
either the code of the calling context or the eval code is strict code.
Instead such bindings are instantiated in a new VariableEnvironment that
is only accessible to the eval code.

Direct Call to Eval

A direct call to the eval function is one that is expressed as a
CallExpression that meets all of the following conditions:

-   The Reference that is the result of evaluating the MemberExpression
    in the CallExpression will always have an environment record as its
    base value and its referenced name is "eval".

-   -   The result of calling the abstract operation GetValue with that
    Reference as the argument is the standard built-in function defined
    in 18.2.1.

Eval Declaration Instantiation

isFinite (number)

Returns FALSE if the argument coerces to NAN, +∞, or −∞, and otherwise
returns TRUE.

1.  Let num be ToNumber(number).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(num).

3.  If num is NAN, +∞, or −∞, return FALSE.

4.  Otherwise, return TRUE.

isNaN (number)

Returns TRUE if the argument coerces to NAN, and otherwise returns
FALSE.

1.  Let num be ToNumber(number).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(num).

3.  If num is NAN, return TRUE.

4.  Otherwise, return FALSE.

NOTE A reliable way for ECMAScript code to test if a value X is a NAN is
an expression of the form X !== X. The result will be TRUE if and only
if X is a NAN.

parseFloat (string)

The PARSEFLOAT function produces a Number value dictated by
interpretation of the contents of the string argument as a decimal
literal.

When the PARSEFLOAT function is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let inputString be ToString(string).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(inputString).

3.  Let trimmedString be a substring of inputString consisting of
    the leftmost code unit that is not a StrWhiteSpaceChar and all
    code units to the right of that code unit. (In other words, remove
    leading white space.) If inputString does not contain any such
    code units, let trimmedString be the empty string.

4.  If neither trimmedString nor any prefix of trimmedString
    satisfies the syntax of a StrDecimalLiteral (see 7.1.3.1), return
    NAN.

5.  Let numberString be the longest prefix of trimmedString, which
    might be trimmedString itself, that satisfies the syntax of a
    StrDecimalLiteral.

6.  Return the Number value for the MV of numberString.

NOTE PARSEFLOAT may interpret only a leading portion of string as a
Number value; it ignores any code units that cannot be interpreted as
part of the notation of an decimal literal, and no indication is given
that any such code units were ignored.

parseInt (string , radix)

The PARSEINT function produces an integer value dictated by
interpretation of the contents of the string argument according to the
specified radix. Leading white space in string is ignored. If
radix is UNDEFINED or 0, it is assumed to be 10 except when the number
begins with the code unit pairs 0X or 0X, in which case a radix of 16 is
assumed. If radix is 16, the number may also optionally begin with the
code unit pairs 0X or 0X.

When the PARSEINT function is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let inputString be ToString(string).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(string).

3.  Let S be a newly created substring of inputString consisting of
    the first code unit that is not a StrWhiteSpaceChar and all code
    unit following that code unit. (In other words, remove leading white
    space.) If inputString does not contain any such code unit, let
    S be the empty string.

4.  Let sign be 1.

5.  If S is not empty and the first code unit of S is U+002D
    (HYPHEN-MINUS), let sign be −1.

6.  If S is not empty and the first code unit of S is U+002B (PLUS
    SIGN) or U+002D (HYPHEN-MINUS), then remove the first code unit from
    S.

7.  Let R = ToInt32(radix).

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(R).

9.  Let stripPrefix be TRUE.

10. If R ≠ 0, then

    a.  If R < 2 or R > 36, then return NAN.

    b.  If R ≠ 16, let stripPrefix be FALSE.

11. Else R = 0,

    a.  Let R = 10.

12. If stripPrefix is TRUE, then

    a.  If the length of S is at least 2 and the first two code units
        of S are either “0X” or “0X”, then remove the first two code
        units from S and let R = 16.

13. If S contains any code units that is not a radix-R digit, then
    let Z be the substring of S consisting of all code units before
    the first such code unit; otherwise, let Z be S.

14. If Z is empty, return NAN.

15. Let mathInt be the mathematical integer value that is represented
    by Z in radix-R notation, using the letters A-Z and A-Z for
    digits with values 10 through 35. (However, if R is 10 and Z
    contains more than 20 significant digits, every significant digit
    after the 20th may be replaced by a 0 digit, at the option of the
    implementation; and if R is not 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, or 32, then
    mathInt may be an implementation-dependent approximation to the
    mathematical integer value that is represented by Z in radix-R
    notation.)

16. Let number be the Number value for mathInt.

17. Return sign × number.

NOTE PARSEINT may interpret only a leading portion of string as an
integer value; it ignores any code units that cannot be interpreted as
part of the notation of an integer, and no indication is given that any
such code units were ignored.

URI Handling Functions 

Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs, are Strings that identify
resources (e.g. web pages or files) and transport protocols by which to
access them (e.g. HTTP or FTP) on the Internet. The ECMAScript language
itself does not provide any support for using URIs except for functions
that encode and decode URIs as described in 18.2.6.2, 18.2.6.3, 18.2.6.4
and 18.2.6.5

NOTE Many implementations of ECMAScript provide additional functions and
methods that manipulate web pages; these functions are beyond the scope
of this standard.

URI Syntax and Semantics

A URI is composed of a sequence of components separated by component
separators. The general form is:

Scheme : First / Second ; Third ? Fourth

where the italicized names represent components and “:”, “/”, “;” and
“?” are reserved for use as separators. The ENCODEURI and DECODEURI
functions are intended to work with complete URIs; they assume that any
reserved code units in the URI are intended to have special meaning and
so are not encoded. The ENCODEURICOMPONENT and DECODEURICOMPONENT
functions are intended to work with the individual component parts of a
URI; they assume that any reserved codce units represent text and so
must be encoded so that they are not interpreted as reserved code units
when the component is part of a complete URI.

The following lexical grammar specifies the form of encoded URIs.

- _ . ! ~ * ' ( )

NOTE The above syntax is based upon RFC 2396 and does not reflect
changes introduced by the more recent RFC 3986.

RUNTIME SEMANTICS

When a code unit to be included in a URI is not listed above or is not
intended to have the special meaning sometimes given to the reserved
code units, that code unit must be encoded. The code unit is transformed
into its UTF-8 encoding, with surrogate pairs first converted from
UTF-16 to the corresponding code point value. (Note that for code units
in the range [0,127] this results in a single octet with the same
value.) The resulting sequence of octets is then transformed into a
String with each octet represented by an escape sequence of the form
“%xx”.

Runtime Semantics: Encode Abstract Operation

The encoding and escaping process is described by the abstract operation
Encode taking two String arguments string and unescapedSet.

1.  Let strLen be the number of code units in string.

2.  Let R be the empty String.

        ii. Let R be a new String value computed by concatenating the
            previous value of R and S.

        i.  If the code unit value of C is not less than 0xDC00 and
            not greater than 0xDFFF, throw a URIERROR exception.

        ii. If the code unit value of C is less than 0xD800 or greater
            than 0xDBFF, then

            2.  Let S be a String containing three code units “%XY”
                where XY are two uppercase hexadecimal digits encoding
                the value of jOctet.

            3.  Let R be a new String value computed by concatenating
                the previous value of R and S.

            4.  Increase j by 1.

                    C.

            3.  Else C is in reservedSet,

                a.  Let S be the substring of string from position
                    start to position k included.

        vii. Else the most significant bit in B is 1,

            1.  Let n be the smallest nonnegative integer such that
                (B << n) & 0x80 is equal to 0.

            2.  If n equals 1 or n is greater than 4, throw a
                URIERROR exception.

            3.  Let Octets be an array of 8-bit integers of size n.

            4.  Put B into Octets at position 0.

            5.  If k + (3 × (n – 1)) is greater than or equal to
                strLen, throw a URIERROR exception.

            6.  Let j be 1.

                    within string do not represent hexadecimal digits,
                    throw a URIERROR exception.

                d.  Let B be the 8-bit value represented by the two
                    hexadecimal digits at position (k + 1) and (k +
                    2).

                e.  If the two most significant bits in B are not 10,

    f.  Increase k by 1.

NOTE This syntax of Uniform Resource Identifiers is based upon RFC 2396
and does not reflect the more recent RFC 3986 which replaces RFC 2396. A
formal description and implementation of UTF-8 is given in RFC 3629.

In UTF-8, characters are encoded using sequences of 1 to 6 octets. The
only octet of a "sequence" of one has the higher-order bit set to 0, the
remaining 7 bits being used to encode the character value. In a sequence
of n octets, n>1, the initial octet has the n higher-order bits set to
1, followed by a bit set to 0. The remaining bits of that octet contain
bits from the value of the character to be encoded. The following octets
all have the higher-order bit set to 1 and the following bit set to 0,
leaving 6 bits in each to contain bits from the character to be encoded.
The possible UTF-8 encodings of ECMAScript characters are specified in
Table 39.

Where

uuuuu = vvvv + 1

to account for the addition of 0x10000 as in Surrogates, section 3.7, of
the Unicode Standard.

The range of code unit values 0xD800-0xDFFF is used to encode surrogate
pairs; the above transformation combines a UTF-16 surrogate pair into a
UTF-32 representation and encodes the resulting 21-bit value in UTF-8.
Decoding reconstructs the surrogate pair.

RFC 3629 prohibits the decoding of invalid UTF-8 octet sequences. For
example, the invalid sequence C0 80 must not decode into the code unit
U+0000. Implementations of the Decode algorithm are required to throw a
URIERROR when encountering such invalid sequences.

decodeURI (encodedURI)

The DECODEURI function computes a new version of a URI in which each
escape sequence and UTF-8 encoding of the sort that might be introduced
by the ENCODEURI function is replaced with the UTF-16 encoding of the
code points that it represents. Escape sequences that could not have
been introduced by ENCODEURI are not replaced.

When the DECODEURI function is called with one argument encodedURI,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let uriString be ToString(encodedURI).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(uriString).

3.  Let reservedURISet be a String containing one instance of each
    code unit valid in uriReserved plus “#”.

4.  Return the result of calling Decode(uriString, reservedURISet)

NOTE The code point “#” is not decoded from escape sequences even though
it is not a reserved URI code point.

 decodeURIComponent (encodedURIComponent)

The DECODEURICOMPONENT function computes a new version of a URI in which
each escape sequence and UTF-8 encoding of the sort that might be
introduced by the ENCODEURICOMPONENT function is replaced with the
UTF-16 encoding of the code points that it represents.

When the DECODEURICOMPONENT function is called with one argument
encodedURIComponent, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let componentString be ToString(encodedURIComponent).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(componentString).

3.  Let reservedURIComponentSet be the empty String.

4.  Return Decode(componentString, reservedURIComponentSet)

encodeURI (uri)

The ENCODEURI function computes a new version of an UTF-16 encoded URI
in which each instance of certain code points is replaced by one, two,
three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the
code points.

When the ENCODEURI function is called with one argument uri, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let uriString be ToString(uri).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(uriString).

3.  Let unescapedURISet be a String containing one instance of each
    code unit valid in uriReserved and uriUnescaped plus "#".

4.  Return Encode(uriString, unescapedURISet)

NOTE The code point "#" is not encoded to an escape sequence even though
it is not a reserved or unescaped URI code point.

encodeURIComponent (uriComponent)

The ENCODEURICOMPONENT function computes a new version of an UTF-16
encoded URI in which each instance of certain code points is replaced by
one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8
encoding of the code point.

When the ENCODEURICOMPONENT function is called with one argument
uriComponent, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let componentString be ToString(uriComponent).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(componentString).

3.  Let unescapedURIComponentSet be a String containing one instance
    of each code unit valid in uriUnescaped.

4.  Return Encode(componentString, unescapedURIComponentSet)

FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS 


Object Objects

The Object Constructor

The Object constructor is the %Object% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the OBJECT property of the global object. When OBJECT is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type
conversion.

The OBJECT constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration.

NOTE Subclass constructors that inherit from the Object constructor
typically should not include a SUPER call to OBJECT as it performs no
initialization action on its THIS value and does not return its THIS
value as its value.

Object ( [ value ] )

When OBJECT function is called with optional argument value, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If value is NULL, UNDEFINED or not supplied, return
    ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%).

2.  Return ToObject(value).

new Object ( ...argumentsList )

When OBJECT is called as part of a new expression , it creates a new
object:

1.  Let F be the OBJECT function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of F,
    providing UNDEFINED and argumentsList as the arguments.

The above steps defined the [[Construct]] internal method of the Object
constructor. Object may not be implemented as an ECMAScript function
object because this definition differs from the definition of
[[Construct]] used by ECMAScript function objects.

Properties of the Object Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Object constructor
is the standard built-in Function prototype object.

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Object constructor
has the following properties:

Object.assign ( target, ...sources )

The ASSIGN function is used to copy the values of all of the enumerable
own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
When the ASSIGN function is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let to be ToObject(target).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(to).

3.  If fewer than two arguments were passed, then return to.

4.  Let sources be the List of argument values starting with the
    second argument.

5.  For each element nextSource of sources, in ascending index
    order,

    a.  Let from be ToObject(nextSource).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(from).

    c.  Let keysArray be the result of calling the [[OwnPropertyKeys]]
        internal method of nextSource.

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(keysArray).

    e.  Let lenValue be Get(keysArray, "LENGTH").

    f.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

    h.  Let nextIndex be 0.

    i.  j.  Let pendingException be UNDEFINED.

    k.  Repeat while nextIndex _< len_,

        i.  ii. iii. iv. v.  Let nextKey be Get(keysArray,
            ToString(nextIndex)).

        vi. ReturnIfAbrupt(nextKey).

        vii. Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]]
            internal method of from with argument nextKey.

        viii. If desc is an abrupt completion, then

            1.  If pendingException is UNDEFINED, then set
                pendingException to desc.

        ix. Else if desc is not UNDEFINED and desc.[[Enumerable]] is

this specification will continue to be thrown even if the THIS value is
UNDEFINED or NULL.

this specification will continue to be thrown even if the THIS value is
UNDEFINED or NULL.

Object.prototype.toLocaleString ( [ reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ] )

When the TOLOCALESTRING method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  Return the result of Invoke(O, "TOSTRING").

The the optional parameters to this method are not used but may be
passed by inplementations that include ECMA-402 support. Implementations
that do not include ECMA-402 support must not use those parameters
position.

NOTE 1 This method provides a generic TOLOCALESTRING implementation for
objects that have no locale-specific TOSTRING behaviour. ARRAY, NUMBER,
DATE, and TYPED ARRAYS provide their own locale-sensitive TOLOCALESTRING
methods.

NOTE 2 ECMA-402 intentionally does not provide an alternative to this
default implementation.

    be "FUNCTION".

9.  Else, if O has an [[ErrorData]] internal slot, then let
    builtinTag be "ERROR".

10. Else, if O has a [[BooleanData]] internal slot, then let
    builtinTag be "BOOLEAN".

11. Else, if O has a [[NumberData]] internal slot, then let
    builtinTag be "NUMBER".

12. Else, if O has a [[DateValue]] internal slot, then let
    builtinTag be "DATE".

13. Else, if O has a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot, then let
    builtinTag be "REGEXP".

14. Else, let builtinTag be "OBJECT".

15. Let hasTag be the result of HasProperty(O, @@toStringTag).

16. ReturnIfAbrupt(hasTag).

18. Else,

    a.  Let tag be the result of Get(O, @@toStringTag).

    b.  If tag is an abrupt completion, let tag be
        NormalCompletion("???").

    c.  Let tag be tag.[[value]].

        string value "~" concatenated with the current value of tag.

19. Return the String value that is the result of concatenating the
    three Strings "[OBJECT ", tag, and "]".

NOTE Historically, this function was occasionally used to access the
string value of the [[Class]] internal slot that was used in previous
editions of this specification as a nominal type tag for various
built-in objects. The above definition of TOSTRING preserves
compatability for legacy code that uses TOSTRING as a reliable test for
those specific kinds of built-in objects. It does not provide a reliable
type testing mechanism for other kinds of built-in or program defined
objects. In addition, programs can use @@toStringTag in ways that will
invalidate the reliability of such legacy type tests.

Object.prototype.valueOf ( )

When the VALUEOF method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  Return O.

Properties of Object Instances

Object instances have no special properties beyond those inherited from
the Object prototype object.


Function Objects

The Function Constructor

The Function constructor is the %Function% intrinsic object and the
initial value of the FUNCTION property of the global object. When
FUNCTION is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it
creates and initializes a new Function object. Thus the function call
FUNCTION(…) is equivalent to the object creation expression NEW
FUNCTION(…) with the same arguments. However, if the THIS value passed
in the call is an Object with a [[Code]] internal slot whose value is
UNDEFINED, it initializes the THIS value using the argument values. This
permits FUNCTION to be used both as factory method and to perform
constructor instance initialization.

FUNCTION may be subclassed and subclass constructors may perform a SUPER
invocation of the FUNCTION constructor to initialize subclass instances.
However, all syntactic forms for defining function objects create
instances of FUNCTION. There is no syntactic means to create instances
of FUNCTION subclasses except for the built-in Generator Function
subclass.

Function ( p1, p2, … , pn, body )

The last argument specifies the body (executable code) of a function;
any preceding arguments specify formal parameters.

When the FUNCTION function is called with some arguments p1, p2, … ,
pn, body (where n might be 0, that is, there are no “p”
arguments, and where body might also not be provided), the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let argCount be the total number of arguments passed to this
    function invocation.

2.  Let P be the empty String.

3.  If argCount = 0, let bodyText be the empty String.

4.  Else if argCount = 1, let bodyText be that argument.

5.  Else argCount > 1,

    a.  Let firstArg be the first argument.

    b.  Let P be ToString(firstArg).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(P).

    d.  Let k be 2.

    e.  Repeat, while k < argCount

        i.  Let nextArg be the k’th argument.

        ii. Let nextArgString be ToString(nextArg).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(nextArgString).

        iv. Let P be the result of concatenating the previous value of
            P, the String "," (a comma), and nextArgString.

        v.  Increase k by 1.

    f.  Let bodyText be the k’th argument.

6.  Let bodyText be ToString(bodyText).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(bodyText).

8.  Let parameters be the result of parsing P, interpreted as UTF-16
    encoded Unicode text as described in 10.1.1, using
    FormalParameters as the goal symbol. Throw a SYNTAXERROR exception
    if the parse fails.

9.  Let body be the result of parsing bodyText, interpreted as
    UTF-16 encoded Unicode text as described in 10.1.1, using
    FunctionBody as the goal symbol. Throw a SYNTAXERROR exception if
    the parse fails or if any static semantics errors are detected.

10. 11. If any element of the BoundNames of parameters also occurs in
    the LexicallyDeclaredNames of body, then throw a SYNTAXERROR
    exception.

12. If bodyText is strict mode code (see 10.2.1) then let strict be
    TRUE, else let strict be FALSE.

13. Let scope be the Global Environment.

14. Let F be the THIS value.

15. If Type(F) is not Object or if F does not have a [[Code]]
    internal slot or if the value of [[Code]] is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let C be the active function object.

    b.  Let proto be the result of GetPrototypeFromConstructor(C,
        "%FUNCTIONPROTOTYPE%").

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

    d.  Let F be FunctionAllocate(C, strict).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(F).

16. 17. If the value of F’s [[FunctionKind]] internal slot is not
    "NORMAL", then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

18. Let isExtensible be IsExtensible(F).

19. ReturnIfAbrupt(isExtensible).

20. If isExtensible is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

21. 22. Let status be FunctionInitialize(F, Normal, strict,
    parameters, body, scope).

23. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

24. If ReferencesSuper of body is TRUE or ReferencesSuper of
    parameters is TRUE, then

    a.  Perform MakeMethod(F, UNDEFINED, UNDEFINED).

25. Let status be the result of MakeConstructor with argument F.

26. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

27. Let hasName be HasOwnProperty(F, "NAME").

28. ReturnIfAbrupt(hasName).

29. If hasName is FALSE, then

    a.  Let status be SetFunctionName(F, "ANONYMOUS").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

30. Return F.

The LENGTH property of the FUNTION function is 1 (see 19.2.2.1).

NOTE 1 A PROTOTYPE property is automatically created for every function
created using the FUNCTION constructor, to provide for the possibility
that the function will be used as a constructor.

NOTE 2 It is permissible but not necessary to have one argument for each
formal parameter to be specified. For example, all three of the
following expressions produce the same result:

  new Function("a", "b", "c", "return a+b+c")

  new Function("a, b, c", "return a+b+c")

  new Function("a,b", "c", "return a+b+c")

new Function ( ...argumentsList )

When FUNCTION is called as part of a NEW expression, it initializes the
newly created object.

1.  Let F be the FUNCTION function object on which the NEW operator
    was applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If FUNCTION is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Function Constructor

The Function constructor is itself a built-in Function object. The value
of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Function constructor is
%FunctionPrototype%, the intrinsic Function prototype object (19.2.3).

The value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot of the Function
constructor is TRUE.

The Function constructor has the following properties:

Function.length

This is a data property with a value of 1. This property has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Function.prototype

The value of FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE is %FunctionPrototype%, the intrinsic
Function prototype object (19.2.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Function[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let proto be the result of GetPrototypeFromConstructor(F,
    "%FUNCTIONPROTOTYPE%").

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

4.  Return FunctionAllocate(proto, FALSE).

5.  

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE The Function @@CREATE function passes FALSE as the strict
parameter to FunctionAllocate. This causes the allocated ECMAScript
function object to have the internal methods of a non-strict constructor
function. The FUNCTION constructor may reset the functions [[Strict]]
internal slot to TRUE. It is up to the implementation whether this also
changes the internal methods.

Properties of the Function Prototype Object

The Function prototype object is itself a Built-in Function object. When
invoked, it accepts any arguments and returns UNDEFINED.

NOTE The Function prototype object is specified to be a function object
to ensure compatibility with ECMAScript code that was created prior to
the 6^th^ Edition of this specification.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Function prototype
object is the intrinsic object %ObjectPrototype% (19.1.3). The initial
value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot of the Function prototype
object is TRUE.

The Function prototype object does not have a PROTOTYPE property.

The value of The LENGTH property of the Function prototype object is 0.

The value of the NAME property of the Function prototype object is the
empty String.

Function.prototype.apply ( thisArg, argArray )

When the APPLY method is called on an object func with arguments
thisArg and argArray, the following steps are taken:

1.  If IsCallable(func) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  If argArray is NULL or UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
        func, providing thisArg as thisArgument and an empty List
        of arguments as argumentsList.

3.  Let argList be the result of CreateListFromArrayLike(argArray).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(argList ).

5.  Perform PrepareForTailCall().

6.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func,
    providing thisArg as thisArgument and argList as
    argumentsList.

The LENGTH property of the APPLY method is 2.

NOTE The thisArg value is passed without modification as the THIS value.
This is a change from Edition 3, where an UNDEFINED or NULL thisArg is
replaced with the global object and ToObject is applied to all other
values and that result is passed as the THIS value. Even though the
thisArg is passed without modification, non-strict mode functions still
perform these transfromations upon entry to the function.

NOTE If func is an arrow function or a bound found then the thisArg
will be ignored by the function [[Call]] in step 6.

Function.prototype.bind ( thisArg , ...args)

When the BIND is called with argument thisArg and zero or more args,
it performs the following steps:

1.  Let Target be the THIS value.

2.  If IsCallable(Target) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let args be a new (possibly empty) List consisting of all of the
    argument values provided after thisArg in order.

4.  Let F be BoundFunctionCreate(Target, thisArg, args).

5.  Let targetRealm be GetFunctionRealm(Target).

6.  Perform AddRestrictedFunctionProperties(F, targetRealm).

7.  Let targetHasLength be HasOwnProperty(Target, "LENGTH").

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(targetHasLength).

9.  If targetHasLength is TRUE, then

    a.  Let targetLen be Get(Target, "LENGTH").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(targetLen).

    c.  If Type(targetLen) is not Number, then let L be 0.

    d.  Else,

        i.  Let L be the larger of 0 and the result of targetLen
            minus the number of elements of A.

10. Else let L be 0.

11. Let status be DefinePropertyOrThrow(F, "LENGTH",
    PropertyDescriptor {[[Value]]: L, [[Writable]]: FALSE,
    [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE}.

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

13. Let targetName be Get(Target, "NAME").

14. ReturnIfAbrupt(targetName).

15. If Type(targetName) is not String, then let targetName be the
    empty string.

16. 17. Let status be SetFunctionName(F, targetName, "NAME").

18. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

19. 20. Return F.

The LENGTH property of the BIND method is 1.

NOTE 1 Function objects created using FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.BIND are exotic
objects. They also do not have a PROTOTYPE property.

NOTE 2 If Target is an arrow function or a bound found then the
thisArg passed to this method will not be used by subsequent calls to
F.

Function.prototype.call (thisArg , ...args)

When the CALL method is called on an object func with argument,
thisArg and zero or more args, the following steps are taken:

1.  If IsCallable(func) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  Let argList be an empty List.

3.  If this method was called with more than one argument then in left
    to right order starting with _the second argument_ append each
    argument as the last element of argList

4.  Perform PrepareForTailCall().

5.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func,
    providing thisArg as thisArgument and argList as
    argumentsList.

The LENGTH property of the CALL method is 1.

NOTE 1 The thisArg value is passed without modification as the THIS
value. This is a change from Edition 3, where an UNDEFINED or NULL
thisArg is replaced with the global object and ToObject is applied to
all other values and that result is passed as the THIS value. Even
though the thisArg is passed without modification, non-strict mode
functions still perform these transfromations upon entry to the
function.

NOTE 2 If func is an arrow function or a bound found then the
thisArg will be ignored by the function [[Call]] in step 5.

Function.prototype.constructor

The initial value of FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the intrinsic
object %Function%.

.Function.prototype.toMethod (newHome [ , methodName ] )

When the TOMETHOD method is called on an object func with argument
newHome and optional argument methodName the following steps are
taken:

1.  If Type(newHome) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  If func is an ECMAScript function object or an exotic Built-in
    function object, then

    a.  b.  c.  If methodName is not UNDEFINED, then

        i.  Let methodName be ToPropertyKey(methodName).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(methodName).

    d.  Return CloneMethod(func, newHome, methodName).

3.  a.  

4.  If func is a Bound Function exotic object, then return
    BoundFunctionClone(func).

5.  If func is any other exotic function object that supports the
    equivalent of the CloneMethod abstract operation, then return an
    appropriately cloned object.

6.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

The LENGTH property of the TOMETHOD method is 1.

Function.prototype.toString ( )

An implementation-dependent String source code representation of the
THIS object is returned. This representation has the syntax of a
FunctionDeclaration FunctionExpression, _GeneratorDeclaration,
GeneratorExpession, ClassDeclaration_, ClassExpression,
ArrowFunction, MethodDefinition, or GeneratorMethod depending upon
the actual characteristics of the object. In particular that the use and
placement of white space, line terminators, and semicolons within the
representation String is implementation-dependent.

If the object was defined using ECMAScript code and the returned string
representation is in the form of a FunctionDeclaration
FunctionExpression, _GeneratorDeclaration, GeneratorExpession,
ClassDeclaration_, ClassExpression, or ArrowFunction then the
representation must be such that if the string is evaluated, using EVAL
in a lexical context that is equivalent to the lexical context used to
create the original object, it will result in a new functionally
equivalent object. The returned source code must not mention freely any
variables that were not mentioned freely by the original function’s
source code, even if these “extra” names were originally in scope. If
the implementation cannot produce a source code string that meets these
criteria then it must return a string for which EVAL will throw a
SYNTAXERROR exception.

The TOSTRING function is not generic; it throws a TYPEERROR exception if
its THIS value does not have a [[Call]] internal method. Therefore, it
cannot be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Function.prototype[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Return the result of calling OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F,
    "%OBJECTPROTOTYPE%").

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE This is the default @@create method that is inherited by all
ordinary constructor functions that do not explicitly over-ride it.

Function.prototype[@@hasInstance] ( V )

When the @@hasInstance method of an object F is called with value V,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Return the result of OrdinaryHasInstance(F, V).

The value of the NAME property of this function is
"[SYMBOL.HASINSTANCE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

NOTE This is the default implementation of @@HASINSTANCE that most
functions inherit. @@HASINSTANCE is called by the INSTANCEOF operator to
deterimine whether a value is an instance of a specific constructor. An
expression such as

V INSTANCEOF F

evaluates as

F[@@HASINSTANCE](V)

A constructor function can control which objects are recognized as its
instances by INSTANCEOF by exposing a different @@HASINSTANCE method on
the function.

This property is non-writable and non-configurable to prevent tampering
that could be used to globally expose the target function of a bound
function.

Function Instances

Every function instance is an ECMAScript function object and has the
internal slots listed in Table 26.

Function instances that correspond to strict mode functions and function
instances created using the FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.BIND METHOD (19.2.3.2)
have properties named CALLER and ARGUMENTS that throw a TYPEERROR
exception. An ECMAScript implementation must not associate any
implementation specific behaviour with accesses of these properties from
strict mode function code.

The Function instances have the following properties:

length

The value of the LENGTH property is an integer that indicates the
typical number of arguments expected by the function. However, the
language permits the function to be invoked with some other number of
arguments. The behaviour of a function when invoked on a number of
arguments other than the number specified by its LENGTH property depends
on the function. This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE,
[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

name

The value of the NAME property is an String that is descriptive of the
function. The name has no semantic significance but is typically a
variable or property name that is used to refer to the function at its
point of definition in ECMAScript code. This property has the attributes
{ [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Anonymous functions objects that do not have a contextual name
associated with them by this specification do not have a NAME own
property but inherit the NAME property of %FunctionPrototype%.

prototype

Function instances that can be used as a constructor have a PROTOTYPE
property. Whenever such a function instance is created another ordinary
object is also created and is the initial value of the function’s
PROTOTYPE property. Unless otherwise specified, the value of the
prototype property is used to initialize the [[Prototype]] internal slot
of a newly created ordinary object before the Function object is invoked
as a constructor for that newly created object.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

NOTE Function objects created using FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.BIND, or by
evaluating a MethodDefinition (that is not a GeneratorMethod) or an
ArrowFunction grammar production do not have a PROTOTYPE property.


Boolean Objects

The Boolean Constructor 

The Boolean constructor is the %Boolean% intrinsic object and the
initial value of the BOOLEAN property of the global object. When BOOLEAN
is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type
conversion. However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object
with an uninitialized [[BooleanData]] internal slot, it initializes the
THIS value using the argument value. This permits BOOLEAN to be used
both to perform type conversion and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The BOOLEAN constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used
as the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified BOOLEAN behaviour
must include a SUPER call to the BOOLEAN constructor to initialize the
[[BooleanData]] state of subclass instances.

 Boolean ( value )

When BOOLEAN is called with argument value, the following steps are
taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  Let b be ToBoolean(value).

3.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[BooleanData]] internal slot
    and the value of [[BooleanData]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Set the value of O’s [[BooleanData]] internal slot to b.

    b.  Return O.

4.  Return b.

new Boolean ( ...argumentsList )

When BOOLEAN is called as part of a new expression , it initializes a
newly created object:

1.  Let F be the BOOLEAN function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If BOOLEAN is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Boolean Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Boolean constructor
is the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Boolean constructor
has the following properties:

Boolean.prototype

The initial value of BOOLEAN.PROTOTYPE is the Boolean prototype object
(19.3.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Boolean[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%BOOLEANPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[BooleanData]]) ).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[BooleanData]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the
Boolean constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to
ECMAScript code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in
some other manner.

Properties of the Boolean Prototype Object

The Boolean prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not a Boolean
instance and does not have a [[BooleanData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Boolean prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

The abstract operation thisBooleanValue(value) performs the following
steps:

1.  If Type(value) is Boolean, return value.

2.  If Type(value) is Object and value has a [[BooleanData]]
    internal slot, then

    a.  Let b be the value of value’s [[BooleanData]] internal slot.

    b.  If b is not UNDEFINED, then return b.

3.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

Boolean.prototype.constructor

The initial value of BOOLEAN.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in
BOOLEAN constructor.

Boolean.prototype.toString ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let b be thisBooleanValue(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(b).

3.  If b is TRUE, then return "TRUE"; else return "FALSE".

Boolean.prototype.valueOf ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Return thisBooleanValue(THIS value).

Properties of Boolean Instances

Boolean instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
Boolean prototype object. Boolean instances have a [[BooleanData]]
internal slot. The [[BooleanData]] internal slot is the Boolean value
represented by this Boolean object.


Symbol Objects

The Symbol Constructor class

The Symbol constructor is the %Symbol% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the SYMBOL property of the global object. When SYMBOL is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it returns a new Symbol
value.

The SYMBOL constructor is not intended to be used with the NEW operator
or to be subclassed. It may be used as the value of an EXTENDS clause of
a class declaration but a SUPER call to the SYMBOL constructor will not
initialize the state of subclass instances.

 Symbol ( [ description ] )

When SYMBOL is called with optional argument description, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If description is UNDEFINED, then let descString be UNDEFINED.

2.  Else, let descString be ToString(description).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(descString).

4.  Return a new unique Symbol value whose [[Description]] value is
    descString.

new Symbol ( ...argumentsList )

When SYMBOL is called as part of a new expression , it initializes a
newly created object:

1.  Let F be the SYMBOL function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If SYMBOL is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

NOTE Symbol has ordinary [[Construct]] behaviour but the definition of
its @@create method causes NEW SYMBOL to throw a TYPEERROR exception.

Properties of the Symbol Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Symbol constructor
is the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Symbol constructor
has the following properties:

Symbol.create

The initial value of SYMBOL.CREATE is the well known symbol @@create
(Table 1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol.for ( key )

When SYMBOL.FOR is called with argument key it performs the following
steps:

1.  Let stringKey be ToString(key).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(stringKey).

3.  For each element e of the GlobalSymbolRegistry List,

    a.  If SameValue(e.[[key]], stringKey) is TRUE, then return
        e.[[symbol]].

4.  Assert: GlobalSymbolRegistry does not currently contain an entry for
    stringKey.

5.  Let newSymbol be a new unique Symbol value whose [[Description]]
    is stringKey.

6.  Append the record { [[key]]: stringKey, [[symbol]]: newSymbol }
    to the GlobalSymbolRegistry List.

7.  Return newSymbol.

The GlobalSymbolRegistry is a List that is globally available. It is
shared by all Code Realms. Prior to the evaluation of any ECMAScript
code it is initialized as an empty List. Elements of the
GlobalSymbolRegistry are Records with the structure defined in Table 40.

Table 40 — GlobalSymbolRegistry Record Fields

  -------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_   VALUE    USAGE
  [[key]]        A String   A string key used to globally identify a Symbol.
  [[symbol]]     A Symbol   A symbol that can be retrieved from any Realm.
  -------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------------

Symbol.hasInstance

The initial value of SYMBOL.HASINSTANCE is the well known symbol
@@hasInstance (Table 1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol.isConcatSpreadable

@@isConcatSpreadable (Table 1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol.isRegExp

(Table 1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol.iterator

The initial value of SYMBOL.ITERATOR is the well known symbol @@iterator
(Table 1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol.keyFor ( sym )

When SYMBOL.KEYFOR is called with argument sym it performs the
following steps:

1.  If Type(sym) is not Symbol, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  For each element e of the GlobalSymbolRegistry List (see
    19.4.2.2),

    a.  If SameValue(e.[[symbol]], sym) is TRUE, then return
        e.[[key]].

3.  Assert: GlobalSymbolRegistry does not currently contain an entry for
    sym.

4.  Return UNDEFINED.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Symbol[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of a Symbol object F performs the following steps:

1.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of the Symbol Prototype Object

The Symbol prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not a Symbol
instance and does not have a [[SymbolData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Symbol prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

Symbol.prototype.constructor

The initial value of SYMBOL.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in SYMBOL
constructor.

Symbol.prototype.toString ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let s be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(s) is Symbol, then let sym be s.

3.  Else,

    a.  If s does not have a [[SymbolData]] internal slot, then throw
        a TYPEERROR exception.

    b.  Let sym be the value of s’s [[SymbolData]] internal slot.

Symbol.prototype [ @@toPrimitive ] ( hint ) 

This function is called by ECMAScript language operators to convert an
object to a primitive value. The allowed values for hint are
"DEFAULT", "NUMBER", and "STRING". Implicit conversion of Symbol objects
to primitive values is not allowed.

When the @@TOPRIMITIVE method is called with argument hint, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let s be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(s) is Symbol, then return s.

3.  If s does not have a [[SymbolData]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Return the value of s’s [[SymbolData]] internal slot.

1.  

The value of the NAME property of this function is
"[SYMBOL.TOPRIMITIVE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Symbol.prototype [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"SYMBOL".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of Symbol Instances

Symbol instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
Symbol prototype object. Symbol instances have a [[SymbolData]] internal
slot. The [[SymbolData]] internal slot is the Symbol value represented
by this Symbol object.


Error Objects

Instances of Error objects are thrown as exceptions when runtime errors
occur. The Error objects may also serve as base objects for user-defined
exception classes.

The Error Constructor 

The Error constructor is the %Error% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the ERROR property of the global object. When ERROR is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it creates and initializes a
new Error object. Thus the function call ERROR(…) is equivalent to the
object creation expression NEW ERROR(…) with the same arguments.
However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object with an
uninitialized [[ErrorData]] internal slot, it initializes the THIS value
using the argument value rather than creating a new object. This permits
ERROR to be used both as factory method and to perform constructor
instance initialization.

The ERROR constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified ERROR behaviour
should include a SUPER call to the ERROR constructor to initialize
subclass instances.

Error ( message )

When the ERROR function is called with argument message the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let func be the active function object.

2.  Let O be the THIS value.

3.  If Type(O) is not Object or Type(O) is Object and O does not
    have an [[ErrorData]] internal slot or Type(O) is Object and O
    has an [[ErrorData]] internal slot and the value of [[ErrorData]] is
    not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let O be the result of calling
        OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(func, "%ERRORPROTOTYPE%",
        ( [[ErrorData]]) ).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

4.  Assert: Type(O) is Object.

5.  Set the value of O’s [[ErrorData]] internal slot to any value
    other than UNDEFINED.

6.  If message is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let msg be ToString(message).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(msg).

    c.  Let msgDesc be the PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: msg,
        [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]:
        TRUE}.

    d.  Let status be the result of DefinePropertyOrThrow(O,
        "MESSAGE", msgDesc).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

7.  Return O.

new Error ( ...argumentsList )

When ERROR called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList it performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the ERROR function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If ERROR is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Error Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Error constructor is
the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Error constructor
has the following properties:

Error.prototype

The initial value of ERROR.PROTOTYPE is the Error prototype object
(19.5.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Error[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%ERRORPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[ErrorData]]) ).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[ErrorData]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the Error
constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to ECMAScript
code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in some other
manner.

Properties of the Error Prototype Object

The Error prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not an Error
instance and does not have an [[ErrorData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Error prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

Error.prototype.constructor

The initial value of ERROR.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in ERROR
constructor.

Error.prototype.message

The initial value of ERROR.PROTOTYPE.MESSAGE is the empty String.

Error.prototype.name

The initial value of ERROR.PROTOTYPE.NAME is "ERROR".

Error.prototype.toString ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let name be the result of Get(O, "NAME").

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(name).

5.  If name is UNDEFINED, then let name be "ERROR"; else let name
    be ToString(name).

6.  Let msg be the result of Get(O, "MESSAGE").

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(msg).

8.  If msg is UNDEFINED, then let msg be the empty String; else let
    msg be ToString(msg).

9.  If name is the empty String, return msg.

10. If msg is the empty String, return name.

11. Return the result of concatenating name, the code unit U+003A
    (COLON), the code unit U+0020 (SPACE), and msg.

Properties of Error Instances

Error instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
Error prototype object and have an [[ErrorData]] internal slot whose
initial value is UNDEFINED. The only specified uses of [[ErrorData]] is
to flag whether or not an Error instance has been initialized by the
Error constructor and to identify them as Error objects within
OBJECT.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING.

A new instance of one of the NativeError objects below is thrown when
a runtime error is detected. All of these objects share the same
structure, as described in 19.5.6.

URIError

Indicates that one of the global URI handling functions was used in a
way that is incompatible with its definition. See 15.1.3.

NativeError Object Structure

When an ECMAScript implementation detects a runtime error, it throws a
new instance of one of the NativeError objects defined in 19.5.5. Each
of these objects has the structure described below, differing only in
the name used as the constructor name instead of NativeError, in the
NAME property of the prototype object, and in the implementation-defined
MESSAGE property of the prototype object.

For each error object, references to NativeError in the definition
should be replaced with the appropriate error object name from 19.5.5.

NativeError Constructors 

When a NativeError constructor is called as a function rather than as
a constructor, it creates and initializes a new object. A call of the
object as a function is equivalent to calling it as a constructor with
the same arguments. However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an
Object with an uninitialized [[ErrorData]] internal slot, it initializes
the THIS value using the argument value. This permits a NativeError to
be used both as factory method and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The NativeError constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be
used as the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified NativeError
behaviour should include a SUPER call to the NativeError constructor
to initialize subclass instances.

NativeError ( message )

When a NativeError function is called with argument message the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let func be the active function object.

2.  Let O be the THIS value.

3.  If Type(O) is not Object or Type(O) is Object and O does not
    have an [[ErrorData]] internal slot or Type(O) is Object and O
    has an [[ErrorData]] internal slot and the value of [[ErrorData]] is
    not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let O be the result of calling
        OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(func,
        "%NATIVEERRORPROTOTYPE%", ( [[ErrorData]]) ).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

4.  Assert: Type(O) is Object.

5.  Set the value of O’s [[ErrorData]] internal slot to any value
    other than UNDEFINED.

6.  If message is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let msg be ToString(message).

    b.  Let msgDesc be the PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: msg,
        [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]:
        TRUE}.

    c.  Let status be the result of DefinePropertyOrThrow(O,
        "MESSAGE", msgDesc).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

7.  Return O.

The actual value of the string passed in step 3.a is either
"%EVALERRORPROTOTYPE%", "%RANGEERRORPROTOTYPE%",
"%REFERENCEERRORPROTOTYPE%", "%SYNTAXERRORPROTOTYPE%",
"%TYPEERRORPROTOTYPE%", or "%URIERRORPROTOTYPE%" corresponding to which
NativeError constructor is being defined.

new NativeError ( ...argumentsList )

When a NativeError constructor is called as part of a new expression
with argument list argumentsList it performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be this NativeError function object on which the NEW
    operator was applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If a NativeError constructor is implemented as an ECMAScript function
object, its [[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the NativeError Constructors

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a NativeError
constructor is the Error constructor object (19.5.1).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), each NativeError
constructor has the following properties:

NativeError.prototype

The initial value of NATIVEERROR.PROTOTYPE is a NativeError
prototype object (19.5.6.3). Each NativeError constructor has a
separate prototype object.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

NativeError [ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F,
    NativeErrorPrototype, ([[ErrorData]]) ).

3.  Return obj.

The actual value passed as NativeErrorPrototype in step 2 is either
"%EVALERRORPROTOTYPE%", "%RANGEERRORPROTOTYPE%",
"%REFERENCEERRORPROTOTYPE%", "%SYNTAXERRORPROTOTYPE%",
"%TYPEERRORPROTOTYPE%", or "%URIERRORPROTOTYPE%" corresponding to which
NativeError constructor is being defined.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[ErrorData]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the
NativeError constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to
ECMAScript code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in
some other manner.

Properties of the NativeError Prototype Objects

Each NativeError prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not an
Error instance and does not have an [[ErrorData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of each NativeError
prototype object is the standard built-in Error prototype object
(19.5.3).

NativeError.prototype.constructor

The initial value of the CONSTRUCTOR property of the prototype for a
given NativeError constructor is the NativeError constructor
function itself (19.5.6.1).

 NativeError.prototype.message

The initial value of the MESSAGE property of the prototype for a given
NativeError constructor is the empty String.

 NativeError.prototype.name

The initial value of the NAME property of the prototype for a given
NativeError constructor is a string consisting of the name of the
constructor (the name used instead of NativeError).

Properties of NativeError Instances

NativeError instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties
from their NativeError prototype object and have an [[ErrorData]]
internal slot whose initial value is UNDEFINED. The only specified use
of [[ErrorData]] is to flag whether or not an Error or NativeError
instance has been initialized by its constructor.



NUMBERS AND DATES 


Number Objects

The Number Constructor 

The Number constructor is the %Number% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the NUMBER property of the global object. When NUMBER is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type
conversion. However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object
with an uninitialized [[NumberData]] internal slot, it initializes the
THIS value using the argument value. This permits NUMBER to be used both
to perform type conversion and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The NUMBER constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified NUMBER behaviour
must include a SUPER call to the NUMBER constructor to initialize the
[[NumberData]] state of subclass instances.

Number ( [ value ] )

When NUMBER is called with argument number, the following steps are
taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If no arguments were passed to this function invocation, then let
    n be +0.

3.  Else, let n be ToNumber(value).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(n).

5.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[NumberData]] internal slot
    and the value of [[NumberData]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Set the value of O’s [[NumberData]] internal slot to n.

    b.  Return O.

6.  Return n.

new Number ( ...argumentsList )

When NUMBER is called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsListit performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the NUMBER function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return Construct (F, argumentsList).

If NUMBER is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Number Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Number constructor
is the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Number constructor
has the following properties:

Number.EPSILON

The value of Number.EPSILON is the difference between 1 and the smallest
value greater than 1 that is representable as a Number value, which is
approximately 2.2204460492503130808472633361816 x 10‍^−‍16^.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.isFinite ( number )

When the NUMBER.ISFINITE is called with one argument number, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(number) is not Number, return FALSE.

2.  If number is NAN, +∞, or −∞, return FALSE.

3.  Otherwise, return TRUE.

Number.isInteger ( number )

When the NUMBER.ISINTEGER is called with one argument number, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(number) is not Number, return FALSE.

2.  If number is NAN, +∞, or −∞, return FALSE.

3.  Let integer be ToInteger(number).

4.  If integer is not equal to number, return FALSE.

5.  Otherwise, return TRUE.

Number.isNaN ( number )

When the NUMBER.ISNAN is called with one argument number, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(number) is not Number, return FALSE.

2.  If number is NAN, return TRUE.

3.  Otherwise, return FALSE.

NOTE This function differs from the global isNaN function (18.2.3) is
that it does not convert its argument to a Number before determining
whether it is NaN.

Number.isSafeInteger ( number )

When the NUMBER.ISSAFEINTEGER is called with one argument number, the
following steps are taken:

1.  If Type(number) is not Number, return FALSE.

2.  If number is NAN, +∞, or −∞, return FALSE.

3.  Let integer be ToInteger(number).

4.  If integer is not equal to number, return FALSE.

5.  If abs(integer) ≤ 2^53^−1, then return TRUE.

6.  Otherwise, return FALSE.

Number.MAXSAFEINTEGER

The value of Number.MAXSAFEINTEGER is 9007199254740991 (2^53^−1).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

 Number.MAX_VALUE

The value of NUMBER.MAX_VALUE is the largest positive finite value of
the Number type, which is approximately 1.7976931348623157 × 10^308^.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.NaN

The value of NUMBER.NAN is NAN.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY

The value of Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY is −∞.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.MINSAFEINTEGER

The value of Number.MINSAFEINTEGER is −9007199254740991 (−(2^53^−1)).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.MIN_VALUE

The value of NUMBER.MIN_VALUE is the smallest positive value of the
Number type, which is approximately 5 × 10^−324^.

In the IEEE-764 double precision binary representation, the smallest
possible value is a denormalized number. If an implementation does not
support denormalized values, the value of NUMBER.MIN_VALUE must be the
smallest non-zero positive value that can actually be represented by the
implementation.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.parseFloat ( string )

The value of the NUMBER.PARSEFLOAT data property is the same built-in
function object that is the value of the PARSEFLOAT property of the
global object defined in 18.2.4.

Number.parseInt ( string, radix )

The value of the NUMBER.PARSEINT data property is the same built-in
function object that is the value of the PARSEINT property of the global
object defined in 18.2.5.

Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY

The value of Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY is +∞.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number.prototype

The initial value of NUMBER.PROTOTYPE is the Number prototype object
(20.1.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Number[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%NUMBERPROTOTYPE%",
    ( [[NumberData]])).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[NumberData]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the Number
constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to ECMAScript
code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in some other
manner.

Properties of the Number Prototype Object

The Number prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not a Number
instance and does not have a [[NumberData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Number prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the methods of the Number prototype
object defined below are not generic and the THIS value passed to them
must be either a Number value or an object that has a [[NumberData]]
internal slot that has been initialized to a Number value.

The abstract operation thisNumberValue(value) performs the following
steps:

1.  If Type(value) is Number, return value.

2.  If Type(value) is Object and value has a [[NumberData]] internal
    slot, then

    a.  Let n be the value of value’s [[NumberData]] internal slot.

    b.  If n is not UNDEFINED, then return n.

3.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

The phrase “this Number value” within the specification of a method
refers to the result returned by calling the abstract operation
thisNumberValue with the THIS value of the method invocation passed as
the argument.

Number.prototype.constructor

The initial value of NUMBER.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in NUMBER
constructor.

Number.prototype.toExponential ( fractionDigits )

Return a String containing this Number value represented in decimal
exponential notation with one digit before the significand's decimal
point and fractionDigits digits after the significand's decimal point.
If fractionDigits is UNDEFINED, include as many significand digits as
necessary to uniquely specify the Number (just like in ToString except
that in this case the Number is always output in exponential notation).
Specifically, perform the following steps:

1.  Let x be thisNumberValue(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

3.  Let f be ToInteger(fractionDigits).

4.  Assert: f is 0, when fractionDigits is UNDEFINED.

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(f).

6.  If x is NAN, return the String "NAN".

7.  Let s be the empty String.

8.  If x < 0, then

    a.  Let s be "-".

    b.  Let x = –x.

9.  If x = +∞, then

    a.  Return the concatenation of the Strings s and "INFINITY".

10. If f < 0 or f > 20, throw a RANGEERROR exception.

11. If x = 0, then

    a.  Let m be the String consisting of f+1 occurrences of the
        code unit 0x0030.

    b.  Let e = 0.

12. Else x ≠ 0,

    a.  If fractionDigits is not UNDEFINED, then

        i.  Let e and n be integers such that 10^f^ ≤ n <
            10^f+1^ and for which the exact mathematical value of n
            × 10^e_–_f^ – x is as close to zero as possible. If
            there are two such sets of e and n, pick the e and n
            for which n × 10^e_–_f^ is larger.

    b.  Else fractionDigits is UNDEFINED,

        i.  Let e, n, and f be integers such that f ≥ 0, 10^f^
            ≤ n < 10^f+1^, the number value for n × 10^e_–_f^ is
            x, and f is as small as possible. Note that the decimal
            representation of n has f+1 digits, n is not divisible
            by 10, and the least significant digit of n is not
            necessarily uniquely determined by these criteria.

    c.  Let m be the String consisting of the digits of the decimal
        representation of n (in order, with no leading zeroes).

13. If f ≠ 0, then

    a.  Let a be the first element of m, and let b be the
        remaining f elements of m.

    b.  Let m be the concatenation of the three Strings a, ".", and
        b.

14. If e = 0, then

    a.  Let c = "+".

    b.  Let d = "0".

15. Else

    a.  If e > 0, then let c = "+".

    b.  Else e ≤ 0,

        i.  Let c = "-".

        ii. Let e = –e.

    c.  Let d be the String consisting of the digits of the decimal
        representation of e (in order, with no leading zeroes).

16. Let m be the concatenation of the four Strings m, "E", c, and
    d.

17. Return the concatenation of the Strings s and m.

The LENGTH property of the TOEXPONENTIAL method is 1.

If the TOEXPONENTIAL method is called with more than one argument, then
the behaviour is undefined (see clause 17).

An implementation is permitted to extend the behaviour of TOEXPONENTIAL
for values of fractionDigits less than 0 or greater than 20. In this
case TOEXPONENTIAL would not necessarily throw RANGEERROR for such
values.

NOTE For implementations that provide more accurate conversions than
required by the rules above, it is recommended that the following
alternative version of step 12.b.i be used as a guideline:

i.  Let e, n, and f be integers such that f ≥ 0, 10^f^ ≤ n <
    10^f+1^, the number value for n × 10^e_–_f^ is x, and f is as
    small as possible. If there are multiple possibilities for n,
    choose the value of n for which n × 10^e_–_f^ is closest in
    value to x. If there are two such possible values of n, choose
    the one that is even.

Number.prototype.toFixed ( fractionDigits )

Note TOFIXED returns a String containing this Number value represented
in decimal fixed-point notation with fractionDigits digits after the
decimal point. If fractionDigits is UNDEFINED, 0 is assumed.

The following steps are performed:

1.  Let x be thisNumberValue(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

3.  Let f be ToInteger(fractionDigits). (If fractionDigits is
    UNDEFINED, this step produces the value 0).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(f).

5.  If f < 0 or f > 20, throw a RANGEERROR exception.

6.  If x is NAN, return the String "NAN".

7.  Let s be the empty String.

8.  If x < 0, then

    a.  Let s be "-".

    b.  Let x = –x.

9.  If x ≥ 10^21^, then

    a.  Let m = ToString(x).

10. Else x < 10^21^,

    a.  Let n be an integer for which the exact mathematical value of
        n ÷ 10^f^ – x is as close to zero as possible. If there are
        two such n, pick the larger n.

    b.  If n = 0, let m be the String "0". Otherwise, let m be the
        String consisting of the digits of the decimal representation of
        n (in order, with no leading zeroes).

    c.  If f ≠ 0, then

        i.  Let k be the number of elements in m.

        ii. If k ≤ f, then

            1.  Let z be the String consisting of f_+1–_k
                occurrences of the code unit 0x0030.

            2.  Let m be the concatenation of Strings z and m.

            3.  Let k = f + 1.

        iii. Let a be the first k_–_f elements of m, and let b
            be the remaining f elements of m.

        iv. Let m be the concatenation of the three Strings a, ".",
            and b.

11. Return the concatenation of the Strings s and m.

The LENGTH property of the TOFIXED method is 1.

If the TOFIXED method is called with more than one argument, then the
behaviour is undefined (see clause 17).

An implementation is permitted to extend the behaviour of TOFIXED for
values of fractionDigits less than 0 or greater than 20. In this case
TOFIXED would not necessarily throw RANGEERROR for such values.

NOTE The output of TOFIXED may be more precise than TOSTRING for some
values because toString only prints enough significant digits to
distinguish the number from adjacent number values. For example,

(1000000000000000128).TOSTRING() returns "1000000000000000100",
while (1000000000000000128).TOFIXED(0) returns "1000000000000000128".

Number.prototype.toLocaleString( [ reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ])

An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402
Internationalization API must implement the
NUMBER.PROTOTYPE.TOLOCALESTRING method as specified in the ECMA-402
specification. If an ECMAScript implementation does not include the
ECMA-402 API the following specification of the TOLOCALESTRING method is
used.

Produces a String value that represents this Number value formatted
according to the conventions of the host environment’s current locale.
This function is implementation-dependent, and it is permissible, but
not encouraged, for it to return the same thing as TOSTRING.

The meanings of the optional parameters to this method are defined in
the ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402
support must not use those parameter positions for anything else.

The LENGTH property of the TOLOCALESTRING method is 0.

Number.prototype.toPrecision ( precision )

Return a String containing this Number value represented either in
decimal exponential notation with one digit before the significand's
decimal point and precision–1 digits after the significand's decimal
point or in decimal fixed notation with precision significant digits.
If precision is UNDEFINED, call ToString (7.1.12) instead.
Specifically, perform the following steps:

1.  Let x be thisNumberValue(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

3.  If precision is UNDEFINED, return ToString(x).

4.  Let p be ToInteger(precision).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(p).

6.  If x is NAN, return the String "NAN".

7.  Let s be the empty String.

8.  If x < 0, then

    a.  Let s be code unit U+002B (PLUS SIGN).

    b.  Let x = –x.

9.  If x = +∞, then

    a.  Return the String that is the concatenation of s and
        "INFINITY".

10. If p < 1 or p > 21, throw a RANGEERROR exception.

11. If x = 0, then

    a.  Let m be the String consisting of p occurrences of the code
        unit U+0030 (DIGIT ZERO).

    b.  Let e = 0.

12. Else x ≠ 0,

    a.  Let e and n be integers such that 10^p–1^ ≤ n < 10^p^
        and for which the exact mathematical value of n ×
        10^e_–_p+1^ – x is as close to zero as possible. If there
        are two such sets of e and n, pick the e and n for which
        n × 10^e_–_p+1^ is larger.

    b.  Let m be the String consisting of the digits of the decimal
        representation of n (in order, with no leading zeroes).

    c.  If e < –6 or e ≥ p, then

        i.  Assert: e ≠ 0

        ii. Let a be the first element of m, and let b be the
            remaining p–1 elements of m.

        iii. Let m be the concatenation of a, code unit U+002E (FULL
            STOP), and b.

        iv. If e > 0, then

            1.  Let c be code unit U+002B (PLUS SIGN).

        v.  Else e < 0,

            1.  Let c be code unit U+002D (HYPHEN-MINUS).

            2.  Let e = –e.

        vi. Let d be the String consisting of the digits of the
            decimal representation of e (in order, with no leading
            zeroes).

        vii. Return the concatenation of s, m, code unit U+0065
            (LATIN SMALL LETTER E), c, and d.

13. If e = p–1, then return the concatenation of the Strings s and
    m.

14. If e ≥ 0, then

    a.  Let m be the concatenation of the first e+1 elements of m,
        the code unit U+002E (FULL STOP), and the remaining p– (e+1)
        elements of m.

15. Else e < 0,

    a.  Let m be the String fromed by the concatenation of code unit
        U+0030 (DIGIT ZERO), code unit U+002E (FULL STOP), –(e+1)
        occurrences of code unit U+0030 (DIGIT ZERO), and the String
        m.

16. Return the String that is the concatenation of s and m.

The LENGTH property of the TOPRECISION method is 1.

If the TOPRECISION method is called with more than one argument, then
the behaviour is undefined (see clause 17).

An implementation is permitted to extend the behaviour of TOPRECISION
for values of precision less than 1 or greater than 21. In this case
TOPRECISION would not necessarily throw RANGEERROR for such values.

 Number.prototype.toString ( [ radix ] )

NOTE The optional radix should be an integer value in the inclusive
range 2 to 36. If radix not present or is UNDEFINED the Number 10 is
used as the value of radix.

The following steps are performed:

1.  Let x be thisNumberValue(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

3.  If radix is not present, then let radixNumber be 10.

4.  Else if radix is UNDEFINED, then let radixNumber be 10.

5.  Else let radixNumber be ToInteger(radix).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(radixNumber).

7.  If radixNumber < 2 or radixNumber > 36, then throw a RANGEERROR
    exception.

8.  If radixNumber = 10, then return ToString(x).

9.  Return the String representation of this Number value using the
    radix specified by radixNumber. Letters A-Z are used for digits
    with values 10 through 35. The precise algorithm is
    implementation-dependent, however the algorithm should be a
    generalization of that specified in 7.1.12.1.

The TOSTRING function is not generic; it throws a TYPEERROR exception if
its THIS value is not a Number or a Number object. Therefore, it cannot
be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Number.prototype.valueOf ( )

1.  Let x be thisNumberValue(THIS value).

2.  Return x.

Properties of Number Instances

Number instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
Number prototype object. Number instances also have a [[NumberData]]
internal slot. The [[NumberData]] internal slot is the Number value
represented by this Number object.


The Math Object

The Math object is a single ordinary object.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Math object is the
standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

The Math is not a function object. It does not have a [[Construct]]
internal method; it is not possible to use the Math object as a
constructor with the NEW operator. The Math object also does not have a
[[Call]] internal method; it is not possible to invoke the Math object
as a function.

NOTE In this specification, the phrase “the Number value for x” has a
technical meaning defined in 6.1.6.

Function Properties of the Math Object

Each of the following MATH object functions applies the ToNumber
abstract operation to each of its arguments (in left-to-right order if
there is more than one). If ToNumber returns an abrupt completion, that
Completion Record is immediately returned. Otherwise, the function
performs a computation on the resulting Number value(s). The value
returned by each function is a Number.

In the function descriptions below, the symbols NaN, −0, +0, −∞ and +∞
refer to the Number values described in 6.1.6.

NOTE The behaviour of the functions ACOS, ACOSH, ASIN, ASINH, ATAN,
ATANH, ATAN2, CBRT, COS, COSH, EXP, HYPOT, LOG,LOG1P, LOG2, LOG10, POW,
SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, and TANH is not precisely specified here except to
require specific results for certain argument values that represent
boundary cases of interest. For other argument values, these functions
are intended to compute approximations to the results of familiar
mathematical functions, but some latitude is allowed in the choice of
approximation algorithms. The general intent is that an implementer
should be able to use the same mathematical library for ECMAScript on a
given hardware platform that is available to C programmers on that
platform.

Although the choice of algorithms is left to the implementation, it is
recommended (but not specified by this standard) that implementations
use the approximation algorithms for IEEE 754 arithmetic contained in
FDLIBM, the freely distributable mathematical library from Sun
Microsystems (http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm).

Date Objects

Overview of Date Objects and Definitions of Abstract Operations

The following functions are abstract operations that operate on time
values (defined in 20.3.1.1). Note that, in every case, if any argument
to one of these functions is NAN, the result will be NAN.

Time Values and Time Range

A Date object contains a Number indicating a particular instant in time
to within a millisecond. Such a Number is called a _time value_. A time
value may also be NAN, indicating that the Date object does not
represent a specific instant of time.

Time is measured in ECMAScript in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970
UTC. In time values leap seconds are ignored. It is assumed that there
are exactly 86,400,000 milliseconds per day. ECMAScript Number values
can represent all integers from –9,007,199,254,740,992 to
9,007,199,254,740,992; this range suffices to measure times to
millisecond precision for any instant that is within approximately
285,616 years, either forward or backward, from 01 January, 1970 UTC.

The actual range of times supported by ECMAScript Date objects is
slightly smaller: exactly –100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days measured
relative to midnight at the beginning of 01 January, 1970 UTC. This
gives a range of 8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds to either side of 01
January, 1970 UTC.

The exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 01 January, 1970 UTC is
represented by the value +0.

Day Number and Time within Day

A given time value t belongs to day number

Day(t) = floor(t / msPerDay)

where the number of milliseconds per day is

msPerDay = 86400000

The remainder is called the time within the day:

TimeWithinDay(t) = t modulo msPerDay

Year Number

ECMAScript uses an extrapolated Gregorian system to map a day number to
a year number and to determine the month and date within that year. In
this system, leap years are precisely those which are (divisible by 4)
and ((not divisible by 100) or (divisible by 400)). The number of days
in year number y is therefore defined by

  DaysInYear(y) = 365 if (y modulo 4) ≠ 0
  = 366 if (y modulo 4) = 0 and (y modulo 100) ≠ 0
  = 365 if (y modulo 100) = 0 and (y modulo 400) ≠ 0
  = 366 if (y modulo 400) = 0

All non-leap years have 365 days with the usual number of days per month
and leap years have an extra day in February. The day number of the
first day of year y is given by:

DayFromYear(y) = 365 × (y−1970) + floor((y−1969)/4) −
floor((y−1901)/100) + floor((y−1601)/400)

The time value of the start of a year is:

TimeFromYear(y) = msPerDay × DayFromYear(y)

A time value determines a year by:

YearFromTime(t) = the largest integer y (closest to positive
infinity) such that TimeFromYear(y) ≤ t

The leap-year function is 1 for a time within a leap year and otherwise
is zero:

  InLeapYear(t) = 0 if DaysInYear(YearFromTime(t)) = 365
  = 1 if DaysInYear(YearFromTime(t)) = 366

Month Number

Months are identified by an integer in the range 0 to 11, inclusive. The
mapping MonthFromTime(t) from a time value t to a month number is
defined by:

MonthFromTime(t) = 0 if 0 ≤ DayWithinYear(t) < 31
 = 1 if 31 ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 59+InLeapYear(t)
 = 2 if 59+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 90+InLeapYear(t)
 = 3 if 90+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 120+InLeapYear(t)
 = 4 if 120+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 151+InLeapYear(t)
 = 5 if 151+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 181+InLeapYear(t)
 = 6 if 181+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 212+InLeapYear(t)
 = 7 if 212+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 243+InLeapYear(t)
 = 8 if 243+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 273+InLeapYear(t)
 = 9 if 273+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 304+InLeapYear(t)
 = 10 if 304+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 334+InLeapYear(t)
 = 11 if 334+InLeapYear(t) ≤ DayWithinYear (t) < 365+InLeapYear(t)

where

DayWithinYear(t) = Day(t_)−DayFromYear(YearFromTime(_t))

A month value of 0 specifies January; 1 specifies February; 2 specifies
March; 3 specifies April; 4 specifies May; 5 specifies June; 6 specifies
July; 7 specifies August; 8 specifies September; 9 specifies October; 10
specifies November; and 11 specifies December. Note that
MonthFromTime(0) = 0, corresponding to Thursday, 01 January, 1970.

Date Number

A date number is identified by an integer in the range 1 through 31,
inclusive. The mapping DateFromTime(t) from a time value t to a
month number is defined by:

  DateFromTime(t) = DayWithinYear(t)+1 if MonthFromTime(t)=0
   = DayWithinYear(t)−30 if MonthFromTime(t)=1
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−58−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=2
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−89−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=3
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−119−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=4
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−150−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=5
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−180−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=6
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−211−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=7
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−242−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=8
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−272−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=9
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−303−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=10
   = DayWithinYear(t_)−333−InLeapYear(_t) if MonthFromTime(t)=11

Week Day

The weekday for a particular time value t is defined as

WeekDay(t) = (Day(t) + 4) modulo 7

A weekday value of 0 specifies Sunday; 1 specifies Monday; 2 specifies
Tuesday; 3 specifies Wednesday; 4 specifies Thursday; 5 specifies
Friday; and 6 specifies Saturday. Note that WeekDay(0) = 4,
corresponding to Thursday, 01 January, 1970.

Local Time Zone Adjustment

An implementation of ECMAScript is expected to determine the local time
zone adjustment. The local time zone adjustment is a value LocalTZA
measured in milliseconds which when added to UTC represents the local
standard time. Daylight saving time is not reflected by LocalTZA.

NOTE It is recommended that implementations use the time zone
information of the IANA Time Zone Database.

Daylight Saving Time Adjustment

An implementation dependent algorithm using best available information
on time zones to determine the local daylight saving time adjustment
DaylightSavingTA(t), measured in milliseconds. An implementation of
ECMAScript is expected to make its best effort to determine the local
daylight saving time adjustment.

 Local Time

Conversion from UTC to local time is defined by

LocalTime(t) = t + LocalTZA + DaylightSavingTA(t)

Conversion from local time to UTC is defined by

UTC(t) = t – LocalTZA – DaylightSavingTA(t – LocalTZA)

NOTE UTC(LocalTime(t)) is not necessarily always equal to t.

Hours, Minutes, Second, and Milliseconds

The following functions are useful in decomposing time values:

HourFromTime(t) = floor(t / msPerHour) modulo HoursPerDay

MinFromTime(t) = floor(t / msPerMinute) modulo MinutesPerHour

SecFromTime(t) = floor(t / msPerSecond) modulo SecondsPerMinute

msFromTime(t) = t modulo msPerSecond

where

HoursPerDay = 24

MinutesPerHour = 60

SecondsPerMinute = 60

msPerSecond = 1000

msPerMinute = 60000 = msPerSecond × SecondsPerMinute

msPerHour = 3600000 = msPerMinute × MinutesPerHour

MakeTime (hour, min, sec, ms)

The operator MakeTime calculates a number of milliseconds from its four
arguments, which must be ECMAScript Number values. This operator
functions as follows:

1.  If hour is not finite or min is not finite or sec is not
    finite or ms is not finite, return NAN.

2.  Let h be ToInteger(hour).

3.  Let m be ToInteger(min).

4.  Let s be ToInteger(sec).

5.  Let milli be ToInteger(ms).

6.  Let t be h * msPerHour + m * msPerMinute + s * msPerSecond +
    milli, performing the arithmetic according to IEEE 754 rules (that
    is, as if using the ECMAScript operators * and +).

7.  Return t.

MakeDay (year, month, date)

The operator MakeDay calculates a number of days from its three
arguments, which must be ECMAScript Number values. This operator
functions as follows:

1.  If year is not finite or month is not finite or date is not
    finite, return NAN.

2.  Let y be ToInteger(year).

3.  Let m be ToInteger(month).

4.  Let dt be ToInteger(date).

5.  Let ym be y + floor(m /12).

6.  Let mn be m modulo 12.

7.  Find a value t such that YearFromTime(t) is ym and
    MonthFromTime(t) is mn and DateFromTime(t) is 1; but if this
    is not possible (because some argument is out of range), return NAN.

8.  Return Day(t) + dt − 1.

MakeDate (day, time)

The operator MakeDate calculates a number of milliseconds from its two
arguments, which must be ECMAScript Number values. This operator
functions as follows:

1.  If day is not finite or time is not finite, return NAN.

2.  Return day × msPerDay + time.

TimeClip (time)

The operator TimeClip calculates a number of milliseconds from its
argument, which must be an ECMAScript Number value. This operator
functions as follows:

1.  If time is not finite, return NAN.

2.  If abs(time) > 8.64 × 10^15^, return NAN.

3.  Return ToInteger(time) + (+0). (Adding a positive zero converts −0
    to +0.)

NOTE The point of step 3 is that an implementation is permitted a choice
of internal representations of time values, for example as a 64-bit
signed integer or as a 64-bit floating-point value. Depending on the
implementation, this internal representation may or may not distinguish
−0 and +0.

Date Time String Format

ECMAScript defines a string interchange format for date-times based upon
a simplification of the ISO 8601 Extended Format. The format is as
follows: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ

Where the fields are as follows:

This format includes date-only forms:

  YYYY
  YYYY-MM
  YYYY-MM-DD

It also includes “date-time” forms that consist of one of the above
date-only forms immediately followed by one of the following time forms
with an optional time zone offset appended:

  THH:MM
  THH:MM:SS
  THH:MM:SS.SSS

All numbers must be base 10. If the MM or DD fields are absent “01” is
used as the value. If the HH, MM, or SS fields are absent “00” is used
as the value and the value of an absent SSS field is “000”. If the time
zone offset is absent, the date-time is interpreted as a local time.

Illegal values (out-of-bounds as well as syntax errors) in a format
string means that the format string is not a valid instance of this
format.

NOTE 1 As every day both starts and ends with midnight, the two
notations 00:00 and 24:00 are available to distinguish the two midnights
that can be associated with one date. This means that the following two
notations refer to exactly the same point in time: 1995-02-04T24:00 and
1995-02-05T00:00

NOTE 2 There exists no international standard that specifies
abbreviations for civil time zones like CET, EST, etc. and sometimes the
same abbreviation is even used for two very different time zones. For
this reason, ISO 8601 and this format specifies numeric representations
of date and time.

Extended years

ECMAScript requires the ability to specify 6 digit years (extended
years); approximately 285,426 years, either forward or backward, from 01
January, 1970 UTC. To represent years before 0 or after 9999, ISO 8601
permits the expansion of the year representation, but only by prior
agreement between the sender and the receiver. In the simplified
ECMAScript format such an expanded year representation shall have 2
extra year digits and is always prefixed with a + or – sign. The year 0
is considered positive and hence prefixed with a + sign.

NOTE Examples of extended years:

  -283457-03-21T15:00:59.008Z 283458 B.C.
  -000001-01-01T00:00:00Z 2 B.C.
  +000000-01-01T00:00:00Z 1 B.C.
  +000001-01-01T00:00:00Z 1 A.D.
  +001970-01-01T00:00:00Z 1970 A.D.
  +002009-12-15T00:00:00Z 2009 A.D.
  +287396-10-12T08:59:00.992Z 287396 A.D.

The Date Constructor 

The Date constructor is the %Date% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the DATE property of the global object. When DATE is called as
a function rather than as a constructor, it returns a String
representing the current time (UTC). However, if the THIS value passed
in the call is an Object with an uninitialized [[DateValue]] internal
slot, DATE initializes the THIS object using the argument value. This
permits DATE to be used both as a function for creating data strings and
to perform constructor instance initialization.

The DATE constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified DATE behaviour must
include a SUPER call to the DATE constructor to initialize the
[[DateValue]] state of subclass instances.

Date ( year, month [, date [ , hours [ , minutes [ , seconds [ , ms ] ] ] ] ] )

This description applies only if the Date constructor is called with at
least two arguments.

When the DATE function is called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let numberOfArgs be the number of arguments passed to this
    function call.

2.  Assert: numberOfArgs ≥ 2.

3.  Let O be the THIS value.

4.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[DateValue]] internal slot and
    the value of [[DateValue]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let y be ToNumber(year).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(year).

    c.  Let m be ToNumber(month).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(month).

    e.  If date is supplied then let dt be ToNumber(date); else
        let dt be 1.

    f.  ReturnIfAbrupt(dt).

    g.  If hours is supplied then let h be ToNumber(hours); else
        let h be 0.

    h.  ReturnIfAbrupt(h).

    i.  If minutes is supplied then let min be ToNumber(minutes);
        else let min be 0.

    j.  ReturnIfAbrupt(min).

    k.  If seconds is supplied then let s be ToNumber(seconds);
        else let s be 0.

    l.  ReturnIfAbrupt(s).

    m.  If ms is supplied then let milli be ToNumber(ms); else let
        milli be 0.

    n.  ReturnIfAbrupt(milli).

    o.  If y_ is not NAN and 0 ≤ ToInteger(_y) ≤ 99, then let yr
        be 1900+ToInteger(y); otherwise, let yr be y.

    p.  Let finalDate be MakeDate(MakeDay(yr, m, dt),
        MakeTime(h, min, s, milli)).

    q.  Set the [[DateValue]] internal slot of O to
        TimeClip(UTC(finalDate)).

    r.  Return O.

5.  Else,

    a.  Let now be the Number that is the time value (UTC) identifying
        the current time.

    b.  Return ToDateString (now).

 Date ( value )

This description applies only if the Date constructor is called with
exactly one argument.

When the DATE function is called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let numberOfArgs be the number of arguments passed to this
    function call.

2.  Assert: numberOfArgs = 1.

3.  Let O be the THIS value.

4.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[DateValue]] internal slot and
    the value of [[DateValue]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If Type(value) is Object and value has a [[DateValue]]
        internal slot, then

        i.  Let tv be thisTimeValue(value).

    b.  Else,

        i.  Let v be ToPrimitive(value).

        ii. If Type(v) is String, then

            1.  Let tv be the result of parsing v as a date, in
                exactly the same manner as for the PARSE method
                (20.3.3.2). If the parse resulted in an abrupt
                completion, tv is the Completion Record.

        iii. Else,

            1.  Let tv be ToNumber(v).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(tv).

    d.  Set the [[DateValue]] internal slot of O to TimeClip(tv).

    e.  Return O.

5.  Else,

    a.  Let now be the Number that is the time value (UTC) identifying
        the current time.

    b.  Return ToDateString (now).

Date ( )

This description applies only if the Date constructor is called with no
arguments.

When the DATE function is called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let numberOfArgs be the number of arguments passed to this
    function call.

2.  Assert: numberOfArgs = 0.

3.  Let O be the THIS value.

4.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[DateValue]] internal slot and
    the value of [[DateValue]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Set the [[DateValue]] internal slot of O to the time value
        (UTC) identifying the current time.

    b.  Return O.

5.  Else,

    a.  Let now be the Number that is the time value (UTC) identifying
        the current time.

    b.  Return ToDateString (now).

new Date ( ...argumentsList )

When DATE is called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList it performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the DATE function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return Construct (F, argumentsList).

If DATE is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Date Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Date constructor is
the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 7), the Date constructor has
the following properties:

Date.now ( )

The NOW function return a Number value that is the time value
designating the UTC date and time of the occurrence of the call to NOW.

Date.parse ( string )

The PARSE function applies the ToString operator to its argument. If
ToString results in an abrupt completion the Completion Record is
immediately returned. Otherwise, PARSE interprets the resulting String
as a date and time; it returns a Number, the UTC time value
corresponding to the date and time. The String may be interpreted as a
local time, a UTC time, or a time in some other time zone, depending on
the contents of the String. The function first attempts to parse the
format of the String according to the rules (including extended years)
called out in Date Time String Format (20.3.1.15). If the String does
not conform to that format the function may fall back to any
implementation-specific heuristics or implementation-specific date
formats. Unrecognizable Strings or dates containing illegal element
values in the format String shall cause DATE.PARSE to return NAN.

If x is any Date object whose milliseconds amount is zero within a
particular implementation of ECMAScript, then all of the following
expressions should produce the same numeric value in that
implementation, if all the properties referenced have their initial
values:

  X.VALUEOF()

  DATE.PARSE(X.TOSTRING())

  DATE.PARSE(X.TOUTCSTRING())

  DATE.PARSE(X.TOISOSTRING())

However, the expression

  DATE.PARSE(X.TOLOCALESTRING())

is not required to produce the same Number value as the preceding three
expressions and, in general, the value produced by DATE.PARSE is
implementation-dependent when given any String value that does not
conform to the Date Time String Format (20.3.1.15) and that could not be
produced in that implementation by the TOSTRING or TOUTCSTRING method.

Date.prototype

The initial value of DATE.PROTOTYPE is the built-in Date prototype
object (20.3.4).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Date.UTC ( year, month [ , date [ , hours [ , minutes [ , seconds [ , ms ] ] ] ] ] )

When the UTC function is called with fewer than two arguments, the
behaviour is implementation-dependent. When the UTC function is called
with two to seven arguments, it computes the date from year, month
and (optionally) date, hours, minutes, seconds and ms. The
following steps are taken:

1.  Let y be ToNumber(year).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(y).

3.  Let m be ToNumber(month).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(m).

5.  If date is supplied then let dt be ToNumber(date); else let
    dt be 1.

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(dt).

7.  If hours is supplied then let h be ToNumber(hours); else let
    h be 0.

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(h).

9.  If minutes is supplied then let min be ToNumber(minutes); else
    let min be 0.

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(min).

11. If seconds is supplied then let s be ToNumber(seconds); else
    let s be 0.

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(s).

13. If ms is supplied then let milli be ToNumber(ms); else let
    milli be 0.

14. ReturnIfAbrupt(milli).

15. If y_ is not NAN and 0 ≤ ToInteger(_y) ≤ 99, then let yr
    be 1900+ToInteger(y); otherwise, let yr be y.

16. Return TimeClip(MakeDate(MakeDay(yr, m, dt), MakeTime(h,
    min, s, milli))).

The LENGTH property of the UTC function is 7.

NOTE The UTC function differs from the Date constructor in two ways: it
returns a time value as a Number, rather than creating a Date object,
and it interprets the arguments in UTC rather than as local time.

Date[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let obj be OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%DATEPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[DateValue]])).

2.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[DateValue]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the Date
constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to ECMAScript
code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in some other
manner.

Properties of the Date Prototype Object

The Date prototype object is itself an ordinary object. It is not a Date
instance and does not have a [[DateValue]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Date prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (20.3.4).

Unless explicitly defined otherwise, the methods of the Date prototype
object defined below are not generic and the THIS value passed to them
must be an object that has a [[DateValue]] internal slot that has been
initialized to a time value.

The abstract operation thisTimeValue(value) performs the following
steps:

1.  If Type(value) is Object and value has a [[DateValue]] internal
    slot, then

    a.  Let n be the value of value’s [[DateValue]] internal slot.

    b.  If n is not UNDEFINED, then return n.

2.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

In following descriptions of functions that are properties of the Date
prototype object, the phrase “this Date object” refers to the object
that is the THIS value for the invocation of the function. If the Type
of the THIS value is not Object, a TYPEERROR exception is thrown. The
phrase “this time value” within the specification of a method refers to
the result returned by calling the abstract operation thisTimeValue with
the THIS value of the method invocation passed as the argument.

constructor.

Date.prototype.toDateString ( )

This function returns a String value. The contents of the String are
implementation-dependent, but are intended to represent the “date”
portion of the Date in the current time zone in a convenient,
human-readable form.

Date.prototype.toISOString ( )

This function returns a String value representing the instance in time
corresponding to this time value. The format of the String is the Date
Time string format defined in 20.3.1.15. All fields are present in the
String. The time zone is always UTC, denoted by the suffix Z. If this

to other kinds of objects for use as a method. However, it does require
that any such object have a TOISOSTRING method.

Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString ( [ reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ] )

An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402
Internationalization API must implement the
DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOLOCALEDATESTRING method as specified in the ECMA-402
specification. If an ECMAScript implementation does not include the
ECMA-402 API the following specification of the TOLOCALEDATESTRING
method is used.

This function returns a String value. The contents of the String are
implementation-dependent, but are intended to represent the “date”
portion of the Date in the current time zone in a convenient,
human-readable form that corresponds to the conventions of the host
environment’s current locale.

The meaning of the optional parameters to this method are defined in the
ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402
support must not use those parameter positions for anything else.

The LENGTH property of the TOLOCALEDATESTRING method is 0.

Date.prototype.toLocaleString ( [ reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ] )

An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402
Internationalization API must implement the

    internal slot, then

    a.  Let tv be NaN.

3.  Else,

    a.  Let tv be this time value.

4.  Return ToDateString(tv).

NOTE For any Date object d whose milliseconds amount is zero, the
result of Date.parse(d.toString()) is equal to d.valueOf(). See
20.3.3.2.

Runtime Semantics: ToDateString(tv) Abstract Operation

1.  Assert: Type(tv) is Number.

2.  If tv is NaN, then return "INVALID DATE".

3.  Return an implementation-dependent String value that represents tv
    as a date and time in the current time zone using a convenient,
    human-readable form.

Date.prototype.toTimeString ( )

This function returns a String value. The contents of the String are
implementation-dependent, but are intended to represent the “time”
portion of the Date in the current time zone in a convenient,
human-readable form.

 Date.prototype.toUTCString ( )

This function returns a String value. The contents of the String are
implementation-dependent, but are intended to represent this time value
in a convenient, human-readable form in UTC.

NOTE The intent is to produce a String representation of a date that is
more readable than the format specified in 20.3.1.15. It is not
essential that the chosen format be unambiguous or easily machine
parsable. If an implementation does not have a preferred human-readable
format it is recommended to use the format defined in 20.3.1.15 but with
a space rather than a “T” used to separate the date and time elements.

Date.prototype.valueOf ( )

The VALUEOF function returns a Number, which is this time value.

Date.prototype [ @@toPrimitive ] ( hint ) 

This function is called by ECMAScript language operators to convert an
object to a primitive value. The allowed values for hint are
"DEFAULT", "NUMBER", and "STRING". Date objects, are unique among
built-in ECMAScript object in that they treat "DEFAULT" as being
equivalent to "STRING", All other built-in ECMAScript objects treat
"DEFAULT" as being equivalent to "NUMBER".

When the @@TOPRIMITIVE method is called with argument hint, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If hint is the string value "STRING" or the string value "DEFAULT"
    , then

    a.  Let tryFirst be "STRING".

4.  Else if hint is the string value "NUMBER", then

    a.  Let tryFirst be "NUMBER".

5.  Else, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  Return the result of OrdinaryToPrimitive(O, tryFirst).

The value of the NAME property of this function is
"[SYMBOL.TOPRIMITIVE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of Date Instances

Date instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
Date prototype object. Date instances also have a [[DateValue]] internal
slot. The [[DateValue]] internal slot is the time value represented by
this Date object.



 TEXT PROCESSING 


String Objects

The String Constructor 

The String constructor is the %String% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the STRING property of the global object. When STRING is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type
conversion. However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object
with an uninitialized [[StringData]] internal slot, it initializes the
THIS value using the argument value. This permits STRING to be used both
to perform type conversion and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The STRING constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified STRING behaviour
must include a SUPER call to the STRING constructor to initialize the
[[StringData]] state of subclass instances.

String ( value )

When STRING is called with argument value, the following steps are
taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If no arguments were passed to this function invocation, then let
    s be "".

3.  Else, let s be ToString(value).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(s).

5.  If Type(O) is Object and O has a [[StringData]] internal slot
    and the value of [[StringData]] is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let extensible be IsExtensible(O).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(extensible).

    c.  If extensible is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    d.  Let length be the number of code unit elements in s.

    e.  Let status be the result of DefinePropertyOrThrow(O,
        "LENGTH", PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: length, [[Writable]]:
        FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }).

    f.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

    g.  Set the value of O’s [[StringData]] internal slot to s.

    h.  Return O.

6.  Return s.

The LENGTH property of the STRING function is 1.

new String ( ...argumentsList )

When STRING is called as part of a new expression , it initializes a
newly created exotic String object:

1.  Let F be the STRING function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If STRING is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the String Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the String constructor
is the standard built-in Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the String constructor
has the following properties:

String.fromCharCode ( ...codeUnits )

    returned.

The LENGTH property of the FROMCHARCODE function is 1.

String.fromCodePoint ( ...codePoints )

The STRING.FROMCODEPOINT function may be called with any number of
arguments which form the rest parameter codePoints. The following
steps are taken:

1.  Let codePoints be a List containing the arguments passed to this
    function.

2.  Let length be number of elements in codePoints.

3.  Let elements be a new List.

4.  Let nextIndex be 0.

        exception.

    f.  Append the elements of the UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) of nextCP
        to the end of elements.

prototype object (21.1.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

String.raw ( callSite , ...substitutions )

The STRING.RAW function may be called with a variable number of
arguments. The first argument is callSite and the remainder of the
arguments form the List substitutions. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let substitutions be a List consisting of all of the arguments
    passed to this function, starting with the second argument. If fewer
    than two arguments were passed, the List is empty.

2.  Let numberOfSubstitutions be the number of elements in
    substitutions.

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let proto be the result of GetPrototypeFromConstructor(F,
    "%STRINGPROTOTYPE%").

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

4.  Let obj be the result of calling StringCreate (proto).

5.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE [[StringData]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a flag
to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the String
constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to ECMAScript
code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in some other
manner.

Properties of the String Prototype Object

The String prototype object is itself an ordinary object. It is not a
String instance and does not have a [[StringData]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the String prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the methods of the String prototype
object defined below are not generic and the THIS value passed to them
must be either a String value or an object that has a [[StringData]]
internal slot that has been initialized to a String value.

The abstract operation thisStringValue(value) performs the following
steps:

1.  If Type(value) is String, return value.

2.  If Type(value) is Object and value has a [[StringData]] internal
    slot, then

    a.  Let s be the value of value’s [[StringData]] internal slot.

    b.  If s is not UNDEFINED, then return s.

3.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

The phrase “this String value” within the specification of a method
refers to the result returned by calling the abstract operation
thisStringValue with the THIS value of the method invocation passed as
the argument.

String.prototype.charAt ( pos )

NOTE Returns a single element String containing the code unit at element
position pos in the String value resulting from converting this object
to a String. If there is no element at that position, the result is the
empty String. The result is a String value, not a String object.

If pos is a value of Number type that is an integer, then the result
of X.CHARAT(pos) is equal to the result of X.SUBSTRING(pos,
pos+1).

When the CHARAT method is called with one argument pos, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let position be ToInteger(pos).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(position).

6.  Let size be the number of elements in S.

7.  If position < 0 or position ≥ size, return the empty String.

8.  Return a String of length 1, containing one code unit from S,
    namely the code unit at position position, where the first
    (leftmost) code unit in S is considered to be at position 0, the
    next one at position 1, and so on.

NOTE The CHARAT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.charCodeAt ( pos )

NOTE Returns a Number (a nonnegative integer less than 2^16^) that is
the code unit value of the string element at position pos in the
String resulting from converting this object to a String. If there is no
element at that position, the result is NAN.

When the CHARCODEAT method is called with one argument pos, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let position be ToInteger(pos).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(position).

6.  Let size be the number of elements in S.

7.  If position < 0 or position ≥ size, return NAN.

8.  Return a value of Number type, whose value is the code unit value of
    the element at position position in the String S, where the
    first (leftmost) element in S is considered to be at position 0,
    the next one at position 1, and so on.

NOTE The CHARCODEAT function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.codePointAt ( pos )

NOTE Returns a nonnegative integer Number less than 1114112 (0x110000)
that is the UTF-16 encoded code point value starting at the string
element at position pos in the String resulting from converting this
object to a String. If there is no element at that position, the result
is UNDEFINED. If a valid UTF-16 surrogate pair does not begin at pos,
the result is the code unit at pos.

When the CODEPOINTAT method is called with one argument pos, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let position be ToInteger(pos).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(position).

6.  Let size be the number of elements in S.

7.  If position < 0 or position ≥ size, return UNDEFINED.

8.  Let first be the code unit value of the element at index
    position in the String S.

9.  If first < 0xD800 or first > 0xDBFF or position+1 = size,
    then return first.

10. Let second be the code unit value of the element at index
    position+1 in the String S.

11. If second < 0xDC00 or second > 0xDFFF, then return first.

12. Return ((first – 0xD800) × 1024) + (second – 0xDC00) + 0x10000.

NOTE The CODEPOINTAT function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.concat ( ...args )

NOTE When the CONCAT method is called it returns a String consisting of
the string elements of this object (converted to a String) followed by
the string elements of each of the arguments converted to a String. The
result is a String value, not a String object.

When the CONCAT method is called with zero or more arguments the
following steps are taken:

1.  2.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

3.  Let S be ToString(O).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

5.  Let args be a List whose elements are the arguments passed to this
    function.

6.  Let R be S.

7.  Repeat, while args is not empty

    a.  Remove the first element from args and let next be the value
        of that element.

    b.  Let nextString be ToString(next)

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextString).

    d.  Let R be the String value consisting of the string elements in
        the previous value of R followed by the string elements of
        nextString.

8.  Return R.

The LENGTH property of the CONCAT method is 1.

NOTE The CONCAT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.constructor

The initial value of STRING.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in STRING
constructor.

String.prototype.contains ( searchString [ , position ] )

The CONTAINS method takes two arguments, searchString and position,
and performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  If Type(searchString) is Object, then

    a.  Let isRegExp be HasProperty(searchString, @@isRegExp).

    b.  If isRegExp is TRUE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  Let searchStr be ToString(searchString).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchStr).

7.  Let pos be ToInteger(position). (If position is UNDEFINED,
    this step produces the value 0).

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(pos).

9.  Let len be the number of elements in S.

10. Let start be min(max(pos, 0), len).

11. Let searchLen be the number of elements in searchStr.

12. If there exists any integer k not smaller than start such that
    k + searchLen is not greater than len, and for all nonnegative
    integers j less than searchLen, the code unit at position
    k_+_j of S is the same as the code unit at position j of
    searchStr, return TRUE; but if there is no such integer k,
    return FALSE.

The LENGTH property of the CONTAINS method is 1.

NOTE 1 If searchString appears as a substring of the result of
converting this object to a String, at one or more positions that are
greater than or equal to position, then return TRUE; otherwise,
returns FALSE. If position is UNDEFINED, 0 is assumed, so as to search
all of the String.

NOTE 2 Throwing an exception if the first argument is a RegExp is
specified in order to allow future editions to define extensions that
allow such argument values.

NOTE 3 The CONTAINS function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.endsWith ( searchString [ , endPosition] )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  If Type(searchString) is Object, then

5.  Let searchStr be ToString(searchString).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchStr).

7.  Let len be the number of elements in S.

11. Let searchLength be the number of elements in searchStr.

12. Let start be end - searchLength.

13. If start is less than 0, return FALSE.

14. If the searchLength sequence of elements of S starting at
    start is the same as the full element sequence of searchStr,
    return TRUE.

15. Otherwise, return FALSE.

The LENGTH property of the ENDSWITH method is 1.

NOTE 1 Returns TRUE if the sequence of elements of searchString
converted to a String is the same as the corresponding elements of this
object (converted to a String) starting at endPosition – length(this).
Otherwise returns FALSE.

NOTE 2 Throwing an exception if the first argument is a RegExp is
specified in order to allow future editions to define extends that allow
such argument values.

NOTE 3 The ENDSWITH function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.indexOf ( searchString [ , position ] )

NOTE If searchString appears as a substring of the result of
converting this object to a String, at one or more positions that are
greater than or equal to position, then the index of the smallest such
position is returned; otherwise, 1 is returned. If position is
UNDEFINED, 0 is assumed, so as to search all of the String.

The INDEXOF method takes two arguments, searchString and position,
and performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let searchStr be ToString(searchString).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchString).

    this step produces the value 0).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(pos).

8.  Let len be the number of elements in S.

9.  Let start be min(max(pos, 0), len).

10. Let searchLen be the number of elements in searchStr.

11. Return the smallest possible integer k not smaller than start
    such that k+ searchLen is not greater than len, and for all
    nonnegative integers j less than searchLen, the code unit at
    position k_+_j of S is the same as the code unit at position j
    of searchStr; but if there is no such integer k, then return the
    value -1.

The LENGTH property of the INDEXOF method is 1.

NOTE The INDEXOF function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.lastIndexOf ( searchString [ , position ] )

NOTE If searchString appears as a substring of the result of
converting this object to a String at one or more positions that are
smaller than or equal to position, then the index of the greatest such
position is returned; otherwise, 1 is returned. If position is
UNDEFINED, the length of the String value is assumed, so as to search
all of the String.

The LASTINDEXOF method takes two arguments, searchString and
position, and performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let searchStr be ToString(searchString).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchString).

6.  Let numPos be ToNumber(position). (If position is UNDEFINED,

    start such that k+ searchLen is not greater than len, and
    for all nonnegative integers j less than searchLen, the code
    unit at position k_+_j of S is the same as the code unit at
    position j of searchStr; but if there is no such integer k,
    then return the value -1.

The LENGTH property of the LASTINDEXOF method is 1.

NOTE The LASTINDEXOF function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.localeCompare ( that [, reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ] )

An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402
Internationalization API must implement the LOCALECOMPARE method as
specified in the ECMA-402 specification. If an ECMAScript implementation
does not include the ECMA-402 API the following specification of the
LOCALECOMPARE method is used.

When the LOCALECOMPARE method is called with argument that, it returns
a Number other than NAN that represents the result of a locale-sensitive
String comparison of the THIS value (converted to a String) with that
(converted to a String). The two Strings are S and That. The two
Strings are compared in an implementation-defined fashion. The result is
intended to order String values in the sort order specified by the
system default locale, and will be negative, zero, or positive,
depending on whether S comes before That in the sort order, the
Strings are equal, or S comes after That in the sort order,
respectively.

Before perform the comparisons the following steps are performed to
prepare the Strings:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let That be ToString(that).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(That).

The meaning of the optional second and third parameters to this method
are defined in the ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not
include ECMA-402 support must not assign any other interpretation to
those parameter positions.

The LOCALECOMPARE method, if considered as a function of two arguments
THIS and that, is a consistent comparison function (as defined in
22.1.3.24) on the set of all Strings.

The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit
implementers to encode additional information in the value, but the
function is required to define a total ordering on all Strings. If the
implementation performs language-sensitive comparisions it must return 0
when comparing Strings that are considered canonically equivalent by the
Unicode standard.

If no language-sensitive comparison at all is available from the host
environment, this function may perform a bitwise comparison.

The LENGTH property of the LOCALECOMPARE method is 1.

NOTE 1 The LOCALECOMPARE method itself is not directly suitable as an
argument to ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SORT because the latter requires a function
of two arguments.

NOTE 2 This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive
comparison functionality is available to the ECMAScript environment from
the host environment, and to compare according to the rules of the host
environment’s current locale. This function must treat Strings that are
canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical.
It is also recommended that this function not honour Unicode
compatibility equivalences or decompositions. For a definition and
discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2
and 3, as well as Unicode Annex #15, Unicode Normalization Forms and
Unicode Technical Note #5 Canonical Equivalence in Applications. Also
see Unicode Technical Stardard #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm.

NOTE 3 The LOCALECOMPARE function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.match ( regexp )

When the MATCH method is called with argument regexp, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  If Type(regexp) is Object and HasProperty(regexp, @@isRegExp) is
    TRUE, then let rx be regexp;

5.  Else, let rx be the result of the abstract operation RegExpCreate
    (21.2.3.3) with arguments regexp and UNDEFINED.

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(rx).

7.  Return the result of Invoke(rx, "MATCH", ( S )). .

NOTE The MATCH function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.normalize ( [ form ] )

When the NORMALIZE method is called with one argument form, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  If form is not provided or form is UNDEFINED let form be
    "NFC".

5.  Let f be ToString(form).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(f).

7.  If f is not one of "NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", or "NFKD", then throw a
    RANGEERROR Exception.

8.  Let ns be the String value is the result of normalizing S into
    the normalization form named by f as specified in Unicode
    Standard Annex #15, Unicode Normalization Forms.

9.  Return ns.

The LENGTH property of the NORMALIZE method is 0.

NOTE The NORMALIZE function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.repeat ( count )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let n be the result of calling ToInteger(count).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(n).

6.  If n < 0, then throw a RANGEERROR exception.

7.  If n is +∞, then throw a RANGEERROR exception.

8.  Let T be a String value that is made from n copies of S
    appended together. If n is 0, T is the empty String.

9.  Return T.

NOTE 1 This method creates a String consisting of the string elements of
this object (converted to String) repeated count times.

NOTE 2 The REPEAT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.replace (searchValue, replaceValue )

When the REPLACE method is called with arguments searchValue and
replaceValue the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let string be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(string).

4.  If Type(searchValue) is Object and HasProperty(searchValue,
    @@isRegExp) is TRUE, then

    a.  Return Invoke(searchValue, "REPLACE", (string,
        replaceValue)).

5.  Let searchString be ToString(searchValue).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchString).

7.  Let functionalReplace be IsCallable(replaceValue).

8.  If functionReplace is FALSE, then

    a.  Let replaceValue be ToString(replaceValue).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(replaceValue).

9.  Search string for the first occurrence of searchString and let
    pos be the index position within string of the first code unit
    of the matched substring and let matched be searchString. If no
    occurrences of searchString were found, return string.

10. If functionalReplace is TRUE, then

    a.  Let replValue be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of replaceValue passing UNDEFINED as the THIS value and
        a List containing matched, pos, and string as the argument
        list.

    b.  Let replStr be ToString(replValue).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(replStr).

11. Else,

    a.  Let captures be an empty List.

    b.  c.  d.  Let replStr be GetReplaceSubstitution(matched,
        string, pos, captures, replaceValue).

12. Let tailPos be pos + the number of code units in matched.

13. Let newString be the String formed by concatenating the first
    pos code units of string, replStr, and the trailing substring
    of string starting at index tailPos. If pos is 0, the first
    element of the concatenation will be the empty String.

14. Return newString.

NOTE The REPLACE function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Runtime Semantics: GetReplaceSubstitution Abstract Operation

    left-to-right, and, once such a replacement is performed, the new
    replacement text is not subject to further replacements.

12. Return result.

String.prototype.search ( regexp )

When the search method is called with argument regexp, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let string be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(string).

4.  If Type(regexp) is Object and HasProperty(regexp, @@isRegExp) is

        (21.2.3.3) with arguments regexp and UNDEFINED.

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(rx).

7.  Return the result of Invoke(rx, "SEARCH", (string)).

NOTE The SEARCH function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.slice ( start, end )

The SLICE method takes two arguments, start and end, and returns a
substring of the result of converting this object to a String, starting
from element position start and running to, but not including, element
position end (or through the end of the String if end is UNDEFINED).
If start is negative, it is treated as sourceLength_+_start where
sourceLength is the length of the String. If end is negative, it is
treated as sourceLength_+_end where sourceLength is the length of
the String. The result is a String value, not a String object. The
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let len be the number of elements in S.

5.  Let intStart be ToInteger(start).

6.  If end is UNDEFINED, let intEnd be len; else let intEnd be
    ToInteger(end).

7.  If intStart is negative, let from be max(len + intStart,0);
    else let from be min(intStart, len).

8.  If intEnd is negative, let to be max(len + intEnd,0); else
    let to be min(intEnd, len).

9.  Let span be max(to – from,0).

10. Return a String value containing span consecutive elements from
    S beginning with the element at position from.

The LENGTH property of the SLICE method is 2.

NOTE The SLICE function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.split ( separator, limit )

Returns an Array object into which substrings of the result of
converting this object to a String have been stored. The substrings are
determined by searching from left to right for occurrences of
separator; these occurrences are not part of any substring in the
returned array, but serve to divide up the String value. The value of
separator may be a String of any length or it may be a RegExp object.

When the SPLIT method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  If Type(separator) is Object and HasProperty(separator,
    @@isRegExp) is TRUE , then,

    a.  Return the result of Invoke(separator, "SPLIT", (O,
        limit))

4.  Let S be ToString(O).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

6.  Let A be the result of the abstract operation ArrayCreate with
    argument 0.

7.  Let lengthA be 0.

8.  If limit is UNDEFINED, let lim = 2^53^–1; else let lim =
    ToLength(limit).

9.  Let s be the number of elements in S.

10. Let p = 0.

11. Let R be ToString(separator).

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(R).

13. If lim = 0, return A.

14. If separator is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Call CreateDataProperty(A, "0", S).

    b.  Assert: The above call will never result in an abrupt
        completion.

    c.  Return A.

15. If s = 0, then

    a.  Let z be the result of SplitMatch(S, 0, R).

    b.  If z is not FALSE, return A.

    c.  Call CreateDataProperty(A, "0", S).

    d.  Assert: The above call will never result in an abrupt
        completion.

    e.  Return A.

16. Let q = p.

17. Repeat, while q ≠ s

    a.  Let e be the result of SplitMatch(_S, q, R_).

    b.  If e is FALSE, then let q = q+1.

    c.  Else e is an integer index into S,

        i.  If e = p, then let q = q+1.

        ii. Else e ≠ p,

            1.  Let T be a String value equal to the substring of S
                consisting of the code units at positions p
                (inclusive) through q (exclusive).

            2.  Call CreateDataProperty(A, ToString(lengthA), T).

            3.  Assert: The above call will never result in an abrupt
                completion.

            4.  Increment lengthA by 1.

            5.  If lengthA = lim, return A.

            6.  Let p = e.

            7.  Let q = p.

18. Let T be a String value equal to the substring of S consisting
    of the code units at positions p (inclusive) through s
    (exclusive).

19. Call CreateDataProperty(A, ToString(lengthA), T).

20. Assert: The above call will never result in an abrupt completion.

21. Return A.

NOTE The value of separator may be an empty String, an empty regular
expression, or a regular expression that can match an empty String. In
this case, separator does not match the empty substring at the
beginning or end of the input String, nor does it match the empty
substring at the end of the previous separator match. (For example, if
separator is the empty String, the String is split up into individual
code unit elements; the length of the result array equals the length of
the String, and each substring contains one code unit.) If separator
is a regular expression, only the first match at a given position of the
THIS String is considered, even if backtracking could yield a
non-empty-substring match at that position. (For example,
"AB".SPLIT(/A*?/) evaluates to the array ["A","B"], while
"AB".SPLIT(/A*/) evaluates to the array["","B"].)

If the THIS object is (or converts to) the empty String, the result
depends on whether separator can match the empty String. If it can,
the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array
contains one element, which is the empty String.

If separator is a regular expression that contains capturing
parentheses, then each time separator is matched the results
(including any UNDEFINED results) of the capturing parentheses are
spliced into the output array. For example,

"A<B>BOLD</B>AND<CODE>CODED</CODE>".SPLIT(/<(\/)?([^<>]+)>/)

evaluates to the array

["A", UNDEFINED, "B", "BOLD", "/", "B", "AND", UNDEFINED,
 "CODE", "CODED", "/", "CODE", ""]

If separator is UNDEFINED, then the result array contains just one
String, which is the THIS value (converted to a String). If limit is
not UNDEFINED, then the output array is truncated so that it contains no
more than limit elements.

Runtime Semantics: SplitMatch Abstract Operation

The abstract operation SplitMatch takes three parameters, a String S,
an integer q, and a String R, and performs the following in order to
return either FALSE or the end index of a match:

1.  Type(R) must be String. Let r be the number of code units in
    R.

2.  Let s be the number of code units in S.

3.  If q_+_r > s then return FALSE.

4.  If there exists an integer i between 0 (inclusive) and r
    (exclusive) such that the code unit at position q_+_i of S is
    different from the code unit at position i of R, then return
    FALSE.

5.  Return q_+_r.

The LENGTH property of the SPLIT method is 2.

NOTE The SPLIT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.startsWith ( searchString [, position ] )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  5.  6.  7.  If Type(searchString) is Object, then

    a.  Let isRegExp be HasProperty(searchString, @@isRegExp).

    b.  If isRegExp is TRUE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

8.  Let searchStr be ToString(searchString).

9.  ReturnIfAbrupt(searchString)..

10. 11. 12. Let pos be ToInteger(position). (If position is
    UNDEFINED, this step produces the value 0).

13. ReturnIfAbrupt(pos).

14. Let len be the number of elements in S.

15. Let start be min(max(pos, 0), len).

16. Let searchLength be the number of elements in searchStr.

17. If searchLength+start is greater than len, return FALSE.

18. If the searchLength sequence of elements of S starting at
    start is the same as the full element sequence of searchStr,
    return TRUE.

19. Otherwise, return FALSE.

The LENGTH property of the STARTSWITH method is 1.

NOTE 1 This method returns TRUE if the sequence of elements of
searchString converted to a String is the same as the corresponding
elements of this object (converted to a String) starting at position.
Otherwise returns FALSE.

NOTE 2 Throwing an exception if the first argument is a RegExp is
specified in order to allow future editions to define extends that allow
such argument values.

NOTE 3 The STARTSWITH function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.substring ( start, end )

The SUBSTRING method takes two arguments, start and end, and returns
a substring of the result of converting this object to a String,
starting from element position start and running to, but not
including, element position end of the String (or through the end of
the String is end is UNDEFINED). The result is a String value, not a
String object.

If either argument is NAN or negative, it is replaced with zero; if
either argument is larger than the length of the String, it is replaced
with the length of the String.

If start is larger than end, they are swapped.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let len be the number of elements in S.

5.  Let intStart be ToInteger(start).

6.  If end is UNDEFINED, let intEnd be len; else let intEnd be
    ToInteger(end).

7.  Let finalStart be min(max(intStart, 0), len).

8.  Let finalEnd be min(max(intEnd, 0), len).

9.  Let from be min(finalStart, finalEnd).

10. Let to be max(finalStart, finalEnd).

11. Return a String whose length is to - from, containing code units
    from S, namely the code units with indices from through to −1,
    in ascending order.

The LENGTH property of the SUBSTRING method is 2.

NOTE The SUBSTRING function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase ( )

This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as
described in 6.1.4.

This function works exactly the same as TOLOWERCASE except that its
result is intended to yield the correct result for the host
environment’s current locale, rather than a locale-independent result.
There will only be a difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where
the rules for that language conflict with the regular Unicode case
mappings.

NOTE 1 The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that implementations
do not use this parameter position for anything else.

NOTE 2 The TOLOCALELOWERCASE function is intentionally generic; it does
not require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.toLocaleUpperCase ( )

This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as
described in 6.1.4.

This function works exactly the same as TOUPPERCASE except that its
result is intended to yield the correct result for the host
environment’s current locale, rather than a locale-independent result.
There will only be a difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where
the rules for that language conflict with the regular Unicode case
mappings.

NOTE 1 The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that implementations
do not use this parameter position for anything else.

NOTE 2 The TOLOCALEUPPERCASE function is intentionally generic; it does
not require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.toLowerCase ( )

This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as
described in 6.1.4. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let cpList be a List containing in order the code points as
    defined in 6.1.4 of S, starting at the first element of S.

5.  For each code point c in cpList, if the Unicode Character
    Database provides a language insensitive lower case equivalent of
    c then replace c in cpList with that equivalent code point(s).

6.  Let cuList be a new List.

7.  For each code point c in cpList, in order, append to cuList
    the elements of the UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) of c.

8.  Let L be a String whose elements are, in order, the elements of
    cuList .

9.  Return L.

The result must be derived according to the locale-insensitive case
mappings in the Unicode Character Database (this explicitly includes not
only the UnicodeData.txt file, but also all locale-insensitive mappings
in the SpecialCasings.txt file that accompanies it).

NOTE 1 The case mapping of some code points may produce multiple code
points . In this case the result String may not be the same length as
the source String. Because both TOUPPERCASE and TOLOWERCASE have
context-sensitive behaviour, the functions are not symmetrical. In other
words, S.TOUPPERCASE().TOLOWERCASE() is not necessarily equal to
S.TOLOWERCASE().

NOTE 2 The TOLOWERCASE function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.toString ( )

When the TOSTRING method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let s be thisStringValue(THIS value).

2.  Return s.

NOTE For a String object, the TOSTRING method happens to return the same
thing as the VALUEOF method.

String.prototype.toUpperCase ( )

This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as
described in 6.1.4.

This function behaves in exactly the same way as
STRING.PROTOTYPE.TOLOWERCASE, except that code points are mapped to
their uppercase equivalents as specified in the Unicode Character
Database.

NOTE The TOUPPERCASE function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.trim ( )

This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as
described in 6.1.4.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let T be a String value that is a copy of S with both leading
    and trailing white space removed. The definition of white space is
    the union of WhiteSpace and LineTerminator. When determining
    whether a Unicode code point is in Unicode general category “Zs”,
    code unit sequences are interpreted as UTF-16 encoded code point
    sequences as specified in 6.1.4.

5.  Return T.

NOTE The TRIM function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.valueOf ( )

When the VALUEOF method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let s be thisStringValue(THIS value).

2.  Return s.

String.prototype [ @@iterator ]( )

When the @@iterator method is called it returns an Iterator object
(25.1.2) that iterates over the code points of a String value, returning
each code point as a String value. The following steps are taken:

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Return CreateStringIterator(S).

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.ITERATOR]".

Properties of String Instances

String instances are String exotic objects and have the internal methods
specified for such objects. String instances inherit properties from the
String prototype object. String instances also have a [[StringData]]
internal slot.

String instances have a LENGTH property, and a set of enumerable
properties with integer indexed names.

length

The number of elements in the String value represented by this String
object.

Once a String object is initialized, this property is unchanging. It has
the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

String Iterator Objects 

An String Iterator is an object, that represents a specific iteration
over some specific String instance object. There is not a named
constructor for String Iterator objects. Instead, String iterator
objects are created by calling certain methods of String instance
objects.

CreateStringIterator Abstract Operation

Several methods of String objects return Iterator objects. The abstract
operation CreateStringIterator with argument string is used to create
such iterator objects. It performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(string) is String.

2.  3.  Let iterator be the result of
    ObjectCreate(%StringIteratorPrototype%, ([[IteratedString]],
    [[StringIteratorNextIndex]] )).

4.  Set iterator’s [[IteratedString]] internal slot to string.

5.  Set iterator’s [[StringIteratorNextIndex]] internal slot to 0.

6.  Return iterator.

The %StringIteratorPrototype% Object

All String Iterator Objects inherit properties from the
%StringIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. The
%StringIteratorPrototype% object is an ordinary object and its
[[Prototype]] internal slot is the %ObjectPrototype% intrinsic object.
In addition, %StringIteratorPrototype% has the following properties:

%StringIteratorPrototype%.next ( )

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If O does not have all of the internal slots of an String Iterator
    Instance (21.1.5.3), throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Let s be the value of the [[IteratedString]] internal slot of O.

5.  If s is UNDEFINED, then return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED,
    TRUE).

6.  Let position be the value of the [[StringIteratorNextIndex]]
    internal slot of O.

7.  Let len be the number of elements in s.

8.  If position ≥ len, then

    a.  Set the value of the [[IteratedString]] internal slot of O to
        UNDEFINED.

    b.  Return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED, TRUE).

9.  Let first be the code unit value of the element at index
    position in s.

10. If first < 0xD800 or first > 0xDBFF or position+1 = len,
    then let resultString be the string consisting of the single code
    unit first.

11. Else,

    a.  Let second be the code unit value of the element at index
        position+1 in the String S.

    b.  If second < 0xDC00 or second > 0xDFFF, then let
        resultString be the string consisting of the single code unit
        first.

    c.  Else, let resultString be the string consisting of the code
        unit first followed by the code unit second.

12. Let resultSize be the number of code units in resultString.

13. Set the value of the [[StringIteratorNextIndex]] internal slot of
    O to position+ resultSize.

14. Return CreateIterResultObject(resultString, FALSE).

%StringIteratorPrototype% [ @@iterator ] ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Return the THIS value.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.ITERATOR]".

%StringIteratorPrototype% [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"STRING ITERATOR".

Properties of String Iterator Instances

String Iterator instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties
from the %StringIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. String Iterator
instances are initially created with the internal slots listed in Table
44.

Table 42 — Internal Slots of String Iterator Instances

  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INTERNAL SLOT                 DESCRIPTION
  [[IteratedString]]            The String value whose elements are being iterated.
  [[StringIteratorNextIndex]]   The integer index of the next string index to be examined by this iteration.
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RegExp (Regular Expression) Objects

A RegExp object contains a regular expression and the associated flags.

NOTE The form and functionality of regular expressions is modelled after
the regular expression facility in the Perl 5 programming language.

Patterns

The REGEXP constructor applies the following grammar to the input
pattern String. An error occurs if the grammar cannot interpret the
String as an expansion of Pattern.

Pattern Semantics

A regular expression pattern is converted into an internal procedure
using the process described below. An implementation is encouraged to
use more efficient algorithms than the ones listed below, as long as the
results are the same. The internal procedure is used as the value of a
RegExp object’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot.

A Pattern is either a BMP pattern or a Unicode pattern depending upon
whether or not its associated flags contain an "U". A BMP pattern
matches against a String interpreted as consisting of a sequence of
16-bit values that are Unicode code points in the range of the Basic
Multilingual Plane. A Unicode pattern matches against a String
interpreted as consisting of Unicode code points encoded using UTF-16.
In the context of describing the behaviour of a BMP pattern “character”
means a single 16-bit Unicode BMP code point. In the context of
describing the behaviour of a Unicode pattern “character” means a UTF-16
encoded code point. In either context, “character value” means the
numeric value of the code unit or code point.

The semantics of Pattern is defined as if a Pattern was a List of
SourceCharacter values where each SourceCharacter corresponds to a
Unicode code point. If a BMP pattern contains a non-BMP
SourceCharacter the entire pattern is encoded using UTF-16 and the
individual code units of that encoding are used as the elements of the
List.

NOTE For example, consider a pattern expressed in source code as the
single non-BMP character U+1D11E (MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF). Interpreted as
a Unicode pattern, it would be a single element (character) List
consisting of the single code point 0x1D11E. However, interpreted as a
BMP pattern, it is first UTF-16 encoded to produce a two element List
consisting of the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E.

Patterns are passed to the RegExp constructor as ECMAScript string
values in which non-BMP characters are UTF-16 encoded. For example, the
single character MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF pattern, expressed as a string
value, is a String of length 2 whose elements were the code units 0xD834
and 0xDD1E. So no further translation of the string would be necessary
to process it as a BMP pattern consisting of two pattern characters.
However, to process it as a Unicode pattern the string value must
treated as if it was UTF-16 decoded into a List consisting of a single
pattern character, the code point U+1D11E.

An implementation may not actually perform such translations to or from
UTF-16, but the semantics of this specification requires that the result
of pattern matching be as if such translations were performed.

Notation

The descriptions below use the following variables:

-   Input is a List consisting of all of the characters, in order, of
      the String being matched by the regular expression pattern. Each
      character is either a code unit or a code point, depending upon
      the kind of pattern involved. The notation input_[_n] means the
      n^th^ character of input, where n can range between 0
      (inclusive) and InputLength (exclusive).

-   InputLength is the number of characters in Input.

-   NcapturingParens is the total number of left capturing parentheses
      (i.e. the total number of times the Atom :: ( Disjunction )
      production is expanded) in the pattern. A left capturing
      parenthesis is any ( pattern character that is matched by the (
      terminal of the Atom :: ( Disjunction ) production.

-   IgnoreCase is TRUE if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]]
      internal slot contains "I" and otherwise is FALSE.

-   Multiline is TRUE if the RegExp object’s [[OriginalFlags]]
      internal slot contains "M" and otherwise is FALSE.

-   Unicode is TRUE if the RegExp object’s [[OriginalFlags]] internal
      slot contains "U" and otherwise is FALSE.

Furthermore, the descriptions below use the following internal data
structures:

-   A CharSet is a mathematical set of characters, either code units
      or code points depending up the state of the Unicode flag. “All
      characters” means either all code unit values or all code point
      values also depending upon the state if Unicode.

-   A State is an ordered pair (endIndex, captures) where
      endIndex is an integer and captures is a List of
      NcapturingParens values. States are used to represent partial
      match states in the regular expression matching algorithms. The
      endIndex is one plus the index of the last input character
      matched so far by the pattern, while captures holds the results
      of capturing parentheses. The n^th^ element of captures is
      either a List that represents the value obtained by the n^th^
      set of capturing parentheses or UNDEFINED if the n^th^ set of
      capturing parentheses hasn’t been reached yet. Due to
      backtracking, many States may be in use at any time during the
      matching process.

-   A MatchResult is either a State or the special token FAILURE
      that indicates that the match failed.

-   A Continuation procedure is an internal closure (i.e. an internal
      procedure with some arguments already bound to values) that takes
      one State argument and returns a MatchResult result. If an
      internal closure references variables which are bound in the
      function that creates the closure, the closure uses the values
      that these variables had at the time the closure was created. The
      Continuation attempts to match the remaining portion (specified
      by the closure's already-bound arguments) of the pattern against
      Input, starting at the intermediate state given by its State
      argument. If the match succeeds, the Continuation returns the
      final State that it reached; if the match fails, the
      Continuation returns FAILURE.

-   A Matcher procedure is an internal closure that takes two
      arguments — a State and a Continuation — and returns a
      MatchResult result. A Matcher attempts to match a middle
      subpattern (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) of
      the pattern against Input, starting at the intermediate state
      given by its State argument. The Continuation argument should
      be a closure that matches the rest of the pattern. After matching
      the subpattern of a pattern to obtain a new State, the Matcher
      then calls Continuation on that new State to test if the rest
      of the pattern can match as well. If it can, the Matcher returns
      the State returned by Continuation; if not, the Matcher may
      try different choices at its choice points, repeatedly calling
      Continuation until it either succeeds or all possibilities have
      been exhausted.

-   An AssertionTester procedure is an internal closure that takes a
      State argument and returns a Boolean result. The assertion
      tester tests a specific condition (specified by the closure's
      already-bound arguments) against the current place in Input and
      returns TRUE if the condition matched or FALSE if not.

-   An EscapeValue is either a character or an integer. An
      EscapeValue is used to denote the interpretation of a
      DecimalEscape escape sequence: a character ch means that the
      escape sequence is interpreted as the character ch, while an
      integer n means that the escape sequence is interpreted as a
      backreference to the n^th^ set of capturing parentheses.

Pattern

The production Pattern :: Disjunction evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate Disjunction to obtain a Matcher m.

2.  Return an internal closure that takes two arguments, a String str
    and an integer index, and performs the following:

    1.  If Unicode is TRUE, then let Input be a List consisting of
        the sequence of code points of str interpreted as a UTF-16
        encoded Unicode string. Otherwise, let Input be a List
        consisting of the sequence of code units that are the elements
        of str. Input will be used throughout the algorithms in
        21.2.2. Each element of Input is considered to be a character.

    2.  Let listIndex be the index into Input of the character that
        was obtained from element index of str.

    3.  Let InputLength be the number of characters contained in
        Input. This variable will be used throughout the algorithms in
        21.2.2.

    4.  Let c be a Continuation that always returns its State argument
        as a successful MatchResult.

    5.  Let cap be a List of NcapturingParens UNDEFINED values,
        indexed 1 through NcapturingParens.

    6.  Let x be the State (listIndex, cap).

    7.  Call m_(_x, c) and return its result.

NOTE A Pattern evaluates ("compiles") to an internal procedure value.
REGEXP.PROTOTYPE.EXEC and other methods can then apply this procedure to
a String and an offset within the String to determine whether the
pattern would match starting at exactly that offset within the String,
and, if it does match, what the values of the capturing parentheses
would be. The algorithms in 21.2.2 are designed so that compiling a
pattern may throw a SYNTAXERROR exception; on the other hand, once the
pattern is successfully compiled, applying its result internal procedure
to find a match in a String cannot throw an exception (except for any
host-defined exceptions that can occur anywhere such as out-of-memory).

Disjunction

The production Disjunction :: Alternative evaluates by evaluating
Alternative to obtain a Matcher and returning that Matcher.

The production Disjunction :: Alternative | Disjunction evaluates
as follows:

1.  Evaluate Alternative to obtain a Matcher m1.

2.  Evaluate Disjunction to obtain a Matcher m2.

3.  Return an internal Matcher closure that takes two arguments, a State
    x and a Continuation c, and performs the following:

    1.  Call m1_(_x, c) and let r be its result.

    2.  If r isn't FAILURE, return r.

    3.  Call m2_(_x, c) and return its result.

NOTE The | regular expression operator separates two alternatives. The
pattern first tries to match the left Alternative (followed by the
sequel of the regular expression); if it fails, it tries to match the
right Disjunction (followed by the sequel of the regular expression).
If the left Alternative, the right Disjunction, and the sequel all
have choice points, all choices in the sequel are tried before moving on
to the next choice in the left Alternative. If choices in the left
Alternative are exhausted, the right Disjunction is tried instead of
the left Alternative. Any capturing parentheses inside a portion of
the pattern skipped by | produce UNDEFINED values instead of Strings.
Thus, for example,

  /a|ab/.exec("abc")

returns the result "A" and not "AB". Moreover,

  /((a)|(ab))((c)|(bc))/.exec("abc")

returns the array

  ["abc", "a", "a", undefined, "bc", undefined, "bc"]

and not

  ["abc", "ab", undefined, "ab", "c", "c", undefined]

Alternative

The production Alternative :: [empty] evaluates by returning a Matcher
that takes two arguments, a State x and a Continuation c, and
returns the result of calling c_(_x).

The production Alternative :: Alternative Term evaluates as
follows:

1.  Evaluate Alternative to obtain a Matcher m1.

2.  Evaluate Term to obtain a Matcher m2.

3.  Return an internal Matcher closure that takes two arguments, a State
    x and a Continuation c, and performs the following:

    1.  Create a Continuation d that takes a State argument y and
        returns the result of calling m2_(_y, c).

    2.  Call m1_(_x, d) and return its result.

NOTE Consecutive Terms try to simultaneously match consecutive
portions of Input. If the left Alternative, the right Term, and
the sequel of the regular expression all have choice points, all choices
in the sequel are tried before moving on to the next choice in the right
Term, and all choices in the right Term are tried before moving on
to the next choice in the left Alternative.

Term

The production Term :: Assertion evaluates by returning an internal
Matcher closure that takes two arguments, a State x and a Continuation
c, and performs the following:

1.  Evaluate Assertion to obtain an AssertionTester t.

2.  Call t_(_x) and let r be the resulting Boolean value.

3.  If r is FALSE, return FAILURE.

4.  Call c_(_x) and return its result.

The production Term :: Atom evaluates as follows:

1.  Return the Matcher that is the result of evaluating Atom.

The production Term :: Atom Quantifier evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate Atom to obtain a Matcher m.

2.  Evaluate Quantifier to obtain the three results: an integer min,
    an integer (or ∞) max, and Boolean greedy.

3.  If max is finite and less than min, then throw a SYNTAXERROR
    exception.

4.  Let parenIndex be the number of left capturing parentheses in the
    entire regular expression that occur to the left of this production
    expansion's Term. This is the total number of times the Atom ::
    ( Disjunction ) production is expanded prior to this production's
    Term plus the total number of Atom :: ( Disjunction )
    productions enclosing this Term.

5.  Let parenCount be the number of left capturing parentheses in the
    expansion of this production's Atom. This is the total number of
    Atom :: ( Disjunction ) productions enclosed by this
    production's Atom.

6.  Return an internal Matcher closure that takes two arguments, a State
    x and a Continuation c, and performs the following:

    1.  Call RepeatMatcher(m, min, max, greedy, x, c,
        parenIndex, parenCount) and return its result.

Runtime Semantics: RepeatMatcher Abstract Operation

The abstract operation RepeatMatcher takes eight parameters, a Matcher
m, an integer min, an integer (or ∞) max, a Boolean greedy, a
State x, a Continuation c, an integer parenIndex, and an integer
parenCount, and performs the following:

1.  If max is zero, then call c_(_x) and return its result.

2.  Create an internal Continuation closure d that takes one State
    argument y and performs the following:

    1.  If min is zero and y's endIndex is equal to x's
        endIndex, then return FAILURE.

    2.  If min is zero then let min2 be zero; otherwise let min2
        be min–1.

    3.  If max is ∞, then let max2 be ∞; otherwise let max2 be
        max–1.

    4.  Call RepeatMatcher(m, min2, max2, greedy, y, c,
        parenIndex, parenCount) and return its result.

3.  Let cap be a fresh copy of x's captures List.

4.  For every integer k that satisfies parenIndex < k and k ≤
    parenIndex_+_parenCount, set cap_[_k] to UNDEFINED.

5.  Let e be x's endIndex.

6.  Let xr be the State (e, cap).

7.  If min is not zero, then call m_(_xr, d) and return its
    result.

8.  If greedy is FALSE, then

    a.  Call c_(_x) and let z be its result.

    b.  If z is not FAILURE, return z.

    c.  Call m_(_xr, d) and return its result.

9.  Call m_(_xr, d) and let z be its result.

10. If z is not FAILURE, return z.

11. Call c_(_x) and return its result.

NOTE 1 An Atom followed by a Quantifier is repeated the number of
times specified by the Quantifier. A Quantifier can be non-greedy,
in which case the Atom pattern is repeated as few times as possible
while still matching the sequel, or it can be greedy, in which case the
Atom pattern is repeated as many times as possible while still
matching the sequel. The Atom pattern is repeated rather than the
input character sequence that it matches, so different repetitions of
the Atom can match different input substrings.

NOTE 2 If the Atom and the sequel of the regular expression all have
choice points, the Atom is first matched as many (or as few, if
non-greedy) times as possible. All choices in the sequel are tried
before moving on to the next choice in the last repetition of Atom.
All choices in the last (n^th^) repetition of Atom are tried before
moving on to the next choice in the next-to-last (n–1)^st^ repetition of
Atom; at which point it may turn out that more or fewer repetitions of
Atom are now possible; these are exhausted (again, starting with
either as few or as many as possible) before moving on to the next
choice in the (n-1)^st^ repetition of Atom and so on.

Compare

  /a[a-z]{2,4}/.exec("abcdefghi")

which returns "ABCDE" with

  /a[a-z]{2,4}?/.exec("abcdefghi")

which returns "ABC".

Consider also

  /(aa|aabaac|ba|b|c)*/.exec("aabaac")

which, by the choice point ordering above, returns the array

  ["aaba", "ba"]

and not any of:

  ["aabaac", "aabaac"]

  ["aabaac", "c"]

The above ordering of choice points can be used to write a regular
expression that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers
(represented in unary notation). The following example calculates the
gcd of 10 and 15:

  "aaaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".replace(/^(a+)\1*,\1+$/,"$1")

which returns the gcd in unary notation "AAAAA".

NOTE 3 Step 5 of the RepeatMatcher clears Atom's captures each time
Atom is repeated. We can see its behaviour in the regular expression

  /(z)((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec("zaacbbbcac")

which returns the array

  ["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", undefined, "c"]

and not

  ["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", "bbb", "c"]

because each iteration of the outermost * clears all captured Strings
contained in the quantified Atom, which in this case includes capture
Strings numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5.

NOTE 4 Step 1 of the RepeatMatcher's d closure states that, once the
minimum number of repetitions has been satisfied, any more expansions of
Atom that match the empty character sequence are not considered for
further repetitions. This prevents the regular expression engine from
falling into an infinite loop on patterns such as:

  /(a*)*/.exec("b")

or the slightly more complicated:

  /(a*)b\1+/.exec("baaaac")

which returns the array

  ["b", ""]

        provides a simple or common case folding mapping for ch, then
        return

    b.  the result of applying that mapping to ch.

    c.  Else, return ch.

3.  Else,

    a.  Assert: ch is a UTF-16 code unit.

    h.  If ch's code unit value ≥ 128 and cu's code unit value <
        128, then return ch.

    i.  Return cu.

NOTE 1 Parentheses of the form ( Disjunction ) serve both to group the
components of the Disjunction pattern together and to save the result
of the match. The result can be used either in a backreference (\
followed by a nonzero decimal number), referenced in a replace String,
or returned as part of an array from the regular expression matching
internal procedure. To inhibit the capturing behaviour of parentheses,
use the form (?: Disjunction ) instead.

NOTE 2 The form (?= Disjunction ) specifies a zero-width positive
lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside Disjunction
must match at the current position, but the current position is not
advanced before matching the sequel. If Disjunction can match at the
current position in several ways, only the first one is tried. Unlike
other regular expression operators, there is no backtracking into a (?=
form (this unusual behaviour is inherited from Perl). This only matters
when the Disjunction contains capturing parentheses and the sequel of
the pattern contains backreferences to those captures.

For example,

  /(?=(a+))/.exec("baaabac")

matches the empty String immediately after the first B and therefore
returns the array:

  ["", "aaa"]

To illustrate the lack of backtracking into the lookahead, consider:

  /(?=(a+))a*b\1/.exec("baaabac")

This expression returns

  ["aba", "a"]

and not:

  ["aaaba", "a"]

NOTE 3 The form (?! Disjunction ) specifies a zero-width negative
lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside Disjunction
must fail to match at the current position. The current position is not
advanced before matching the sequel. Disjunction can contain capturing
parentheses, but backreferences to them only make sense from within
Disjunction itself. Backreferences to these capturing parentheses from
elsewhere in the pattern always return UNDEFINED because the negative
lookahead must fail for the pattern to succeed. For example,

  /(.*?)a(?!(a+)b\2c)\2(.*)/.exec("baaabaac")

looks for an A not immediately followed by some positive number n of
A's, a B, another n A's (specified by the first \2) and a C. The second
\2 is outside the negative lookahead, so it matches against UNDEFINED
and therefore always succeeds. The whole expression returns the array:

  ["baaabaac", "ba", undefined, "abaac"]

NOTE 4 In case-insignificant matches when Unicode is TRUE, all
characters are implicitly case-folded using the simple mapping provided
by the Unicode standard immediately before they are compared. The simple
mapping always maps to a single code point, so it does not map, for
example, "SS" (U+00DF) to "SS". It may however map a code point outside
the Basic Latin range to a character within, for example, “ſ” (U+017F)
to “s”. Such characters are not mapped if Unicode is FALSE. This
prevents Unicode code points such as U+017F and U+212A from matching
regular expressions such as /[AZ]/I, but they will match /[AZ]/UI.

The production AtomEscape :: DecimalEscape evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate DecimalEscape to obtain an EscapeValue E.

    3.  If s is UNDEFINED, then call c_(_x) and return its result.

    4.  Let e be x's endIndex.

    6.  Let f be e_+_len.

    7.  If f_>_InputLength, return FAILURE.

3.  Call CharacterSetMatcher(A, FALSE) and return its Matcher result.

The production AtomEscape :: CharacterClassEscape evaluates as
follows:

1.  Evaluate CharacterClassEscape to obtain a CharSet A.

2.  Call CharacterSetMatcher(A, FALSE) and return its Matcher result.

NOTE An escape sequence of the form \ followed by a nonzero decimal
number n matches the result of the nth set of capturing parentheses
(see 21.2.2.11). It is an error if the regular expression has fewer than
n capturing parentheses. If the regular expression has n or more
capturing parentheses but the nth one is UNDEFINED because it has not
captured anything, then the backreference always succeeds.

CharacterEscape

The production CharacterEscape :: ControlEscape evaluates by
returning the character according to Table 43.

Table 43 — ControlEscape Character Values

  ----------------- ------------------- -------------- ---------------------- ----------
  CONTROLESCAPE   _CHARACTER VALUE_   _CODE POINT_   _UNICODE NAME_         SYMBOL

DecimalEscape

The production DecimalEscape :: DecimalIntegerLiteral evaluates as
follows:

1.  Let i be the MV of DecimalIntegerLiteral.

2.  If i is zero, return the EscapeValue consisting of the character
    U+0000 (NULL).

3.  Return the EscapeValue consisting of the integer i.

The definition of “the MV of DecimalIntegerLiteral” is in 11.8.3.

NOTE If \ is followed by a decimal number n whose first digit is not
0, then the escape sequence is considered to be a backreference. It is
an error if n is greater than the total number of left capturing
parentheses in the entire regular expression. \0 represents the <NUL>
character and cannot be followed by a decimal digit.

CharacterClassEscape

The production CharacterClassEscape :: D evaluates by returning the
ten-element set of characters containing the characters 0 through 9
inclusive.

The production CharacterClassEscape :: D evaluates by returning the
set of all characters not included in the set returned by

  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

The production CharacterClassEscape :: W evaluates by returning the
set of all characters not included in the set returned by

The production CharacterClass :: [ ClassRanges ] evaluates by
evaluating ClassRanges to obtain a CharSet and returning that CharSet
and the Boolean FALSE.

The production CharacterClass :: [ ^ ClassRanges ] evaluates by
evaluating ClassRanges to obtain a CharSet and returning that CharSet
and the Boolean TRUE.

ClassRanges

The production ClassRanges :: [empty] evaluates by returning the empty
CharSet.

The production ClassRanges :: NonemptyClassRanges evaluates by
evaluating NonemptyClassRanges to obtain a CharSet and returning that
CharSet.

NonemptyClassRanges

The production NonemptyClassRanges :: ClassAtom evaluates as
follows:

1.  Return the CharSet that is the result of evaluating ClassAtom.

The production NonemptyClassRanges :: ClassAtom
NonemptyClassRangesNoDash evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate ClassAtom to obtain a CharSet A.

2.  Evaluate NonemptyClassRangesNoDash to obtain a CharSet B.

3.  Return the union of CharSets A and B.

The production NonemptyClassRanges :: ClassAtom - ClassAtom
ClassRanges evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate the first ClassAtom to obtain a CharSet A.

2.  Evaluate the second ClassAtom to obtain a CharSet B.

3.  Evaluate ClassRanges to obtain a CharSet C.

4.  Call CharacterRange(A, B) and let D be the resulting CharSet.

5.  Return the union of CharSets D and C.

Runtime Semantics: CharacterRange Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CharacterRange takes two CharSet parameters A
and B and performs the following:

1.  If A does not contain exactly one character or B does not
    contain exactly one character then throw a SYNTAXERROR exception.

2.  Let a be the one character in CharSet A.

3.  Let b be the one character in CharSet B.

4.  Let i be the character value of character a.

5.  Let j be the character value of character b.

6.  If i > j then throw a SYNTAXERROR exception.

7.  Return the set containing all characters numbered i through j,
    inclusive.

NonemptyClassRangesNoDash

The production NonemptyClassRangesNoDash :: ClassAtom evaluates as
follows:

1.  Return the CharSet that is the result of evaluating ClassAtom.

The production NonemptyClassRangesNoDash :: ClassAtomNoDash
NonemptyClassRangesNoDash evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate ClassAtomNoDash to obtain a CharSet A.

2.  Evaluate NonemptyClassRangesNoDash to obtain a CharSet B.

3.  Return the union of CharSets A and B.

The production NonemptyClassRangesNoDash :: ClassAtomNoDash -
ClassAtom ClassRanges evaluates as follows:

1.  Evaluate ClassAtomNoDash to obtain a CharSet A.

2.  Evaluate ClassAtom to obtain a CharSet B.

3.  Evaluate ClassRanges to obtain a CharSet C.

4.  Call CharacterRange(A, B) and let D be the resulting CharSet.

5.  Return the union of CharSets D and C.

NOTE 1 ClassRanges can expand into single ClassAtoms and/or ranges
of two ClassAtoms separated by dashes. In the latter case the
ClassRanges includes all characters between the first ClassAtom and
the second ClassAtom, inclusive; an error occurs if either ClassAtom
does not represent a single character (for example, if one is \W) or if
the first ClassAtom's character value is greater than the second
ClassAtom's character value.

NOTE 2 Even if the pattern ignores case, the case of the two ends of a
range is significant in determining which characters belong to the
range. Thus, for example, the pattern /[E-F]/I matches only the letters
E, F, E, and F, while the pattern /[E-F]/I matches all upper and
lower-case letters in the Unicode Basic Latin block as well as the
symbols [, \, ], ^, _, and `.

NOTE 3 A - character can be treated literally or it can denote a range.
It is treated literally if it is the first or last character of
ClassRanges, the beginning or end limit of a range specification, or
immediately follows a range specification.

ClassAtom

The production ClassAtom :: - evaluates by returning the CharSet
containing the one character -.

The production ClassAtom :: ClassAtomNoDash evaluates by evaluating
ClassAtomNoDash to obtain a CharSet and returning that CharSet.

The production ClassEscape :: B evaluates as follows:

1.  Return the CharSet containing the single character <BS> U+0008
    (BACKSPACE).

The production ClassEscape :: CharacterEscape evaluates as follows:

1.  Return the CharSet containing the single character that is the
    result of evaluating CharacterEscape.

The production ClassEscape :: CharacterClassEscape evaluates as
follows:

1.  Return the CharSet that is the result of evaluating
    CharacterClassEscape.

NOTE A ClassAtom can use any of the escape sequences that are allowed
in the rest of the regular expression except for \B, \B, and
backreferences. Inside a CharacterClass, \B means the backspace
character, while \B and backreferences raise errors. Using a
backreference inside a ClassAtom causes an error.

The RegExp Constructor 

The RegExp constructor is the %RegExp% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the REGEXP property of the global object. When REGEXP is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it creates and initializes a
new RegExp object. Thus the function call REGEXP(…) is equivalent to the
object creation expression NEW REGEXP(…) with the same arguments.
However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object with a
[[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot whose value is UNDEFINED, it initializes
the THIS value using the argument values. This permits REGEXP to be used
both as factory method and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The REGEXP constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified REGEXP behaviour
must include a SUPER call to the REGEXP constructor to initialize
subclass instances.

RegExp ( pattern, flags )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let func be the active function object.

2.  Let O be the THIS value.

3.  If Type(O) is not Object or Type(O) is Object and O does not
    have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot or Type(O) is Object and
    O has a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot and the value of
    [[RegExpMatcher]] is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If Type(pattern) is Object and O has a [[RegExpMatcher]]
        internal slot and flags is UNDEFINED, then

        i.  Return pattern;

    b.  Let O be the result of calling the abstract operation
        RegExpAlloc with argument func.

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

4.  If Type(pattern) is Object and pattern has a [[RegExpMatcher]]
    internal slot, then

    a.  If the value of pattern’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is
        UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    b.  If flags is not UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    c.  Let P be the value of pattern’s [[OriginalSource]] internal
        slot.

    d.  Let F be the value of pattern’s [[OriginalFlags]] internal
        slot.

5.  Else,

    a.  Let P be pattern.

    b.  Let F be flags.

6.  Return the result of the abstract operation RegExpInitialize with
    arguments O, P, and F.

NOTE If pattern is supplied using a StringLiteral, the usual escape
sequence substitutions are performed before the String is processed by
RegExp. If pattern must contain an escape sequence to be recognized by
RegExp, any backslash \ code points must be escaped within the
StringLiteral to prevent them being removed when the contents of the
StringLiteral are formed.

new RegExp( ...argumentsList )

When REGEXP is called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList it performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the REGEXP function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If REGEXP is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Abstract Operations for the RegExp Constructor

Runtime Semantics: RegExpAlloc Abstract Operation

When the abstract operation RegExpAlloc with argument constructor is
called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(constructor, "%REGEXPPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[RegExpMatcher]], [[OriginalSource]], [[OriginalFlags]])).

2.  Let status be the result of DefinePropertyOrThrow(obj,
    "LASTINDEX", PropertyDescriptor {[[Writable]]: TRUE,
    [[Enumberable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE}).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

4.  Return obj.

NOTE [[RegExpMatcher]] is initially assigned the value UNDEFINED as a
flag to indicate that the instance has not yet been initialized by the
REGEXP constructor. This flag value is never directly exposed to
ECMAScript code; hence implementations may choose to encode the flag in
some other manner.

Runtime Semantics: RegExpInitialize Abstract Operation

When the abstract operation RegExpInitialize with arguments obj,
pattern, and flags is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  If pattern is UNDEFINED, then let P be the empty String.

2.  Else, let P be ToString(pattern).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(P).

4.  If flags is UNDEFINED, then let F be the empty String.

5.  Else, let F be ToString(flags).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(F).

7.  If F contains any code unit other than "G", "I", "M", "U", or "Y"
    or if it contains the same code unit more than once, then throw a
    SYNTAXERROR exception.

8.  If F contains "U" then let BMP be FALSE, else let BMP be TRUE.

9.  If BMP is TRUE, then

    a.  Parse P interpreted as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points
        using the grammars in 21.2.1. The goal symbol for the parse is
        Pattern.Throw a SYNTAXERROR exception if P did not conform
        to the grammar or if any code point of P were not matched by
        the parse.

    b.  Let patternCharacters be a List whose elements are the code
        unit elements of P.

10. Else

    a.  Parse P interpreted as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points
        using the grammars in 21.2.1. The goal symbol for the parse is
        Pattern~[U]~. Throw a SYNTAXERROR exception if P did not
        conform to the grammar or if any code point of P were not
        matched by the parse.

    b.  Let patternCharacters be a List whose elements are the code
        points of P interpreted as sequence of UTF-16 encoded Unicode
        code points.

11. Set the value of obj’s [[OriginalSource]] internal slot to P.

12. Set the value of obj’s [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot to F.

13. Set obj’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot to the internal
    procedure that evaluates the above parse of P by applying the
    semantics provided in 21.2.2 using patternCharacters as the
    pattern’s List of SourceCharacter values and F as the flag
    parameters.

14. Let putStatus be the result of Put(obj, "LASTINDEX", 0, TRUE).

15. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

16. Return obj.

Runtime Semantics: RegExpCreate Abstract Operation

When the abstract operation RegExpCreate with arguments P and F is
called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let obj be the result of calling the abstract operation
    RegExpAlloc with argument %RegExp%.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(obj).

3.  Return the result of the abstract operation RegExpInitialize with
    arguments obj, P, and F .

Runtime Semantics: EscapeRegExpPattern Abstract Operation

When the abstract operation EscapeRegExpPattern with arguments P and
F is called, the following occurs:

1.  Let S be a String in the form of a Pattern (Pattern~[U]~ if
    F contains "U") equivalent to P interpreted as UTF-16 encoded
    Unicode code points, in which certain code points are escaped as
    described below. S may or may not be identical to P; however,
    the internal procedure that would result from evaluating S as a
    Pattern (Pattern~[U]~ if F contains "U") must behave
    identically to the internal procedure given by the constructed
    object's [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot. Multiple calls to this
    abstract operation using the same values for P and F must
    produce identical results.

2.  The code points / or any LineTerminator occurring in the pattern
    shall be escaped in S as necessary to ensure that the String value
    formed by concatenating the Strings "/", S, "/", and F can be
    parsed (in an appropriate lexical context) as a
    RegularExpressionLiteral that behaves identically to the
    constructed regular expression. For example, if P is "/", then S
    could be "\/" or "\U002F", among other possibilities, but not "/",
    because /// followed by F would be parsed as a SingleLineComment
    rather than a RegularExpressionLiteral. If P is the empty
    String, this specification can be met by letting S be "(?:)".

3.  Return S.

Properties of the RegExp Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the RegExp constructor
is the standard built-in Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 2), the RegExp constructor
has the following properties:

RegExp.prototype

The initial value of REGEXP.PROTOTYPE is the RegExp prototype object
(21.2.5).

This property shall have the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE,
[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

RegExp[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following:

1.  Return the result of calling the abstract operation RegExpAlloc with
    argument F.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of the RegExp Prototype Object

The RegExp prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not a RegExp
instance and does not have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot or any of
the other internal slots of RegExp instance objects.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the RegExp prototype
object is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3).

The RegExp prototype object does not have a VALUEOF property of its own;
however, it inherits the VALUEOF property from the Object prototype
object.

RegExp.prototype.constructor

The initial value of REGEXP.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the standard
built-in REGEXP constructor.

RegExp.prototype.exec ( string )

Performs a regular expression match of string against the regular
expression and returns an Array object containing the results of the
match, or NULL if string did not match.

The String ToString(string) is searched for an occurrence of the
regular expression pattern as follows:

1.  Let R be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(R) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If R does not have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If the value of R’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is UNDEFINED,
    then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  6.  7.  Let S be ToString(string)

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

9.  Return RegExpBuiltinExec(R, S).

Runtime Semantics: RegExpExec ( R, S ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation RegExpExec with arguments R and S performs
the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(R) is Object.

2.  Assert: Type(S) is String.

3.  Let exec be Get(R, "EXEC").

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(exec).

5.  If IsCallable(exec) is TRUE, then

    a.  Let result be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of exec with arguments R, and (S).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(result).

    c.  If Type(result) is neither Object or Null, then throw a
        TYPEERROR exception.

    d.  Return(result).

6.  If R does not have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If the value of R’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is UNDEFINED,
    then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

8.  Return RegExpBuiltinExec(R, S).

NOTE If a callable EXEC property is not found this algorithm falls back
to attempting to use the built-in RegExp matching algoritm. This
provides compatable behaviour for code written for prior editions where
most built-in algorithms that use regular expressions did not perform a
dynamic property lookup of EXEC.

Runtime Semantics: RegExpBuiltinExec ( R, S ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation RegExpBuiltinExec with arguments R and S
performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: R is an initialized RegExp instance.

2.  Assert: Type(S) is String.

3.  4.  5.  Let length be the number of code units in S.

6.  7.  8.  Let lastIndex be Get(R,"LASTINDEX").

9.  Let i be ToInteger(lastIndex).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(i).

11. Let global be ToBoolean(Get(R, "GLOBAL")).

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(global).

13. Let sticky be ToBoolean(Get(R, "STICKY")).

14. ReturnIfAbrupt(sticky).

15. If global is FALSE and sticky is FALSE, then let i = 0.

16. Let matcher be the value of R’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot.

17. Let flags be the value of R’s [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot.

18. If flags contains "U" then let fullUnicode be TRUE, else let
    fullUnicode be FALSE.

19. Let matchSucceeded be FALSE.

20. Repeat, while matchSucceeded is FALSE

    a.  If i < 0 or i > length, then

        i.  ii. Let putStatus be Put(R, "LASTINDEX", 0, TRUE).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

        iv. Return NULL.

    b.  Let r be the result of calling matcher with arguments S
        and i.

    c.  If r is FAILURE, then

        i.  If sticky is TRUE, then

            1.  2.  Let putStatus be Put(R, "LASTINDEX", 0, TRUE).

            3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

            4.  Return NULL.

        ii. Let i = i+1.

    d.  else

        i.  Assert: r is a State.

        ii. Set matchSucceeded to TRUE.

21. Let e be r's endIndex value.

22. If fullUnicode is TRUE, then

    a.  e is an index into the Input character list, derived from
        S, matched by matcher. Let eUTF be the smallest index into
        S that corresponds to the character at element e of Input.
        If e isgreater than the length of Input, then eUTF is 1 +
        the number of code units in _S. _

    b.  Let e be eUTF.

23. If global is TRUE or sticky is TRUE,

    a.  Let putStatus be the result of Put(R, "LASTINDEX", e,
        TRUE).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

24. Let n be the length of r's captures List. (This is the same
    value as 21.2.2.1's NcapturingParens.)

25. Let A be the result of the abstract operation ArrayCreate(n +
    1).

26. Assert: The value of A’s "LENGTH" property is n + 1.

27. Let matchIndex be i.

28. Assert: The following CreateDataProperty calls will not result in an
    abrupt completion.

29. Perform CreateDataProperty(A, "INDEX", matchIndex).

30. Perform CreateDataProperty(A, "INPUT", S).

31. 32. Let matchedSubstr be the matched substring (i.e. the portion
    of S between offset i inclusive and offset e exclusive).

33. Perform CreateDataProperty(A, "0", matchedSubstr).

34. For each integer i such that i > 0 and i ≤ n

    a.  Let captureI be i^th^ element of r's captures List.

        ii. Let capturedValue be a string whose elements are the code
            units of captureI.

    e.  Perform CreateDataProperty(A, ToString(i) ,
        capturedValue).

35. Return A.

get RegExp.prototype.global 

REGEXP.PROTOTYPE.GLOBAL is an accessor property whose set accessor
function is UNDEFINED. Its get accessor function performs the following
steps:

REGEXP.PROTOTYPE.IGNORECASE is an accessor property whose set accessor
function is UNDEFINED. Its get accessor function performs the following
steps:

7.  If either src or flags is UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

8.  Return EscapeRegExpPattern(src, flags).

RegExp.prototype.split ( string, limit )

NOTE Returns an Array object into which substrings of the result of
converting string to a String have been stored. The substrings are
determined by searching from left to right for matches of the THIS value
regular expression; these occurrences are not part of any substring in
the returned array, but serve to divide up the String value.

The THIS value may be an empty regular expression or a regular
expression that can match an empty String. In this case, regular
expression does not match the empty substring at the beginning or end of
the input String, nor does it match the empty substring at the end of
the previous separator match. (For example, if the regular expression
matches the empty String, the String is split up into individual code
unit elements; the length of the result array equals the length of the
String, and each substring contains one code unit.) Only the first match
at a given position of the THIS String is considered, even if
backtracking could yield a non-empty-substring match at that position.
(For example, /A*?/.SPLIT("AB") evaluates to the array ["A","B"], while
/A*/.SPLIT("AB") evaluates to the array["","B"].)

If the string is (or converts to) the empty String, the result depends
on whether the regular expression can match the empty String. If it can,
the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array
contains one element, which is the empty String.

If the regular expression that contains capturing parentheses, then each
time separator is matched the results (including any UNDEFINED
results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the output array.
For example,

/<(\/)?([^<>]+)>/.split("A<B>bold</B>and<CODE>coded</CODE>")

evaluates to the array

["A", undefined, "B", "bold", "/", "B", "and", undefined,"CODE",
"coded", "/", "CODE", ""]

If limit is not UNDEFINED, then the output array is truncated so that
it contains no more than limit elements.

When the SPLIT method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let rx be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(rx) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If rx does not have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot, then throw
    a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If the value of rx’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is UNDEFINED,
    then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  Let matcher be the value of rx’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal
    slot.

17. Repeat, while q ≠ s

    a.  Let z be the result of calling the matcher with arguments
        S and q

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(z).

    c.  If z is FAILURE, then let q = q+1.

    d.  Else z is not FAILURE,

        i.  z must be a State. Let e be z's endIndex and let
            cap be z's captures List.

        ii. If e = p, then let q = q+1.

        iii. Else e ≠ p,

            1.  Let T be a String value equal to the substring of S

                b.  Assert: The following call will never result in an
                    abrupt completion.

                c.  Call CreateDataProperty(A, ToString(lengthA),
                    cap_[_i]).

                d.  Increment lengthA by 1.

                e.  If lengthA = lim, return A.

            8.  Let q = p.

FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE The @@isRegExp property is used by STRING.PROTOTYPE methods to
identify objects that have the basic behaviour of regular expressions.
The absence of a @@isRegExp property or the existence of such a property
whose value is NULL indicates that the object should is not intended to
be used as regular expression object.

Properties of RegExp Instances

RegExp instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
RegExp prototype object. RegExp instances have internal slots
[[RegExpMatcher]], [[OriginalSource]], and [[OriginalFlags]]. The value
of the [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is an implementation dependent
representation of the Pattern of the RegExp object.

NOTE Prior to the 6^th^ Edition, REGEXP instances were specified as
having the own data properties SOURCE, GLOBAL, IGNORECASE, and
MULTILINE. Those properties are now specified as accessor properties of
RegExp.prototype.

RegExp instances also have the following property:

lastIndex

The value of the LASTINDEX property specifies the String position at
which to start the next match. It is coerced to an integer when used
(see 21.2.5.2). This property shall have the attributes { [[Writable]]:
TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.



INDEXED COLLECTIONS 


Array Objects

Array objects are exotic objects that give special treatment to a
certain class of property names. See 9.4.1.4 for a definition of this
special treatment.

An Array object, O, is said to be sparse if the following algorithm
returns TRUE:

1.  Let len be Get(O, "LENGTH").

2.  For each integer i in the range 0≤i_<ToUint32(_len)

    a.  Let elem be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]]
        internal method of O with argument ToString(i).

    b.  If elem is UNDEFINED, return TRUE.

3.  Return FALSE.

The Array Constructor

The Array constructor is the %Array% intrinsic object and the initial
value of the ARRAY property of the global object. When ARRAY is called
as a function rather than as a constructor, it creates and initializes a
new Array object. Thus the function call ARRAY(…) is equivalent to the
object creation expression NEW ARRAY(…) with the same arguments.
However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object with an
[[ArrayInitializationState]] internal slot whose value is UNDEFINED, it
initializes the THIS value using the argument values. This permits ARRAY
to be used both as factory method and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

The ARRAY constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration. Subclass
constructors that intended to inherit the specified ARRAY behaviour must
include a SUPER call to the ARRAY constructor to initialize subclass
instances.

The LENGTH property of the ARRAY constructor function is 1.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If ARRAY is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Array Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Array constructor is
the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Array constructor
has the following properties:

Array.from ( arrayLike [ , mapfn [ , thisArg ] ] )

When the FROM method is called with argument arrayLike and optional
arguments mapfn and thisArg the following steps are taken:

1.  Let C be the THIS value.

2.  Let items be ToObject(arrayLike).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(items).

4.  If mapfn is UNDEFINED, then let mapping be FALSE.

5.  else

    a.  If IsCallable(mapfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    b.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
        UNDEFINED.

    c.  Let mapping be TRUE

6.  Let usingIterator be CheckIterable(items).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(usingIterator).

8.  If usingIterator is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

        i.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal
            method of C with an empty argument list.

    b.  Else,

        i.  Let A be ArrayCreate(0).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

    d.  Let iterator be GetIterator(items, usingIterator).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(iterator).

    f.  Let k be 0.

    g.  Repeat

        i.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

        ii. Let next be IteratorStep(iterator).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

        iv. If next is FALSE, then

            1.  Let putStatus be Put(A, "LENGTH", k, TRUE).

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

            3.  Return A.

        v.  Let nextValue be IteratorValue(next).

        vi. ReturnIfAbrupt(nextValue).

        vii. If mapping is TRUE, then

            1.  Let mappedValue be the result of calling the [[Call]]
                internal method of mapfn with T as thisArgument
                and (nextValue, k) as argumentsList.

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(mappedValue).

        viii. Else, let mappedValue be nextValue.

        ix. Let defineStatus be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(A, Pk,
            mappedValue).

        x.  ReturnIfAbrupt(defineStatus).

        xi. Increase k by 1.

9.  Assert: items is not an Iterator so assume it is an array-like
    object.

10. Let lenValue be Get(items, "LENGTH").

11. Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

13. If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

    a.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal
        method of C with an argument list containing the single item
        len.

14. Else,

    a.  Let A be ArrayCreate(len).

15. ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

16. Let k be 0.

17. Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

    d.  If mapping is TRUE, then

        i.  Let mappedValue be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of mapfn with T as thisArgument and

    f.  Let defineStatus be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(A, Pk,
        mappedValue).

    h.  Increase k by 1.

18. Let putStatus be Put(A, "LENGTH", len, TRUE).

19. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

20. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the FROM method is 1.

NOTE The FROM function is an intentionally generic factory method; it
does not require that its THIS value be the Array constructor. Therefore
it can be transferred to or inherited by any other constructors that may
be called with a single numeric argument.

Array.isArray ( arg )

The ISARRAY function takes one argument arg, and performs the
following:

1.  If Type(arg) is not Object, return FALSE.

2.  If arg is an exotic Array object, then return TRUE.

3.  Return FALSE.

Array.of ( ...items )

When the OF method is called with any number of arguments, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let len be the actual number of arguments passed to this function.

2.  Let items be the List of arguments passed to this function.

3.  4.  Let C be the THIS value.

5.  If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

    a.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal
        method of C with an argument list containing the single item
        len.

6.  Else,

    a.  Let A be ArrayCreate(len).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

8.  Let k be 0.

9.  Repeat, while k < len

    a.  b.  Let kValue be element k of items.

    c.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    d.  Let defineStatus be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(A_,_Pk,
        kValue.[[value]]).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(defineStatus).

    f.  Increase k by 1.

10. Let putStatus be Put(A, "LENGTH", len, TRUE).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

12. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the OF method is 0.

NOTE 1 The items argument is assumed to be a well-formed rest argument
value.

NOTE 2 The OF function is an intentionally generic factory method; it
does not require that its THIS value be the Array constructor. Therefore
it can be transferred to or inherited by other constructors that may be
called with a single numeric argument.

Array.prototype

The value of ARRAY.PROTOTYPE is %ArrayPrototype%, the intrinsic Array
prototype object (22.1.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Array[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let proto be GetPrototypeFromConstructor(F, "%ARRAYPROTOTYPE%").

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

4.  Let obj be ArrayCreate(UNDEFINED, proto).

5.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE 1 Passing UNDEFINED as the first argument to ArrayCreate causes the
[[ArrayInitializationState]] internal slot of the array to be initially
assigned the value FALSE. This is a flag used to indicate that the
instance has not yet been initialized by the ARRAY constructor. This
flag value is never directly exposed to ECMAScript code; hence
implementations may choose to encode the flag in any unobservable
manner.

NOTE 2 The Array @@CREATE function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be the Array constructor object. It can be
transferred to other constructor functions for use as a @@CREATE method.
When used with other constructors, this function will create an exotic
Array object whose [[Prototype]] value is obtained from the associated
constructor.

Properties of the Array Prototype Object

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Array prototype
object is the intrinsic object %ObjectPrototype%.

The Array prototype object is itself an ordinary object. It is not an
Array instance and does not have a LENGTH property .

NOTE The Array prototype object does not have a VALUEOF property of its
own; however, it inherits the VALUEOF property from the standard
built-in Object prototype Object.

Array.prototype.concat ( ...arguments )

When the CONCAT method is called with zero or more arguments, it returns
an array containing the array elements of the object followed by the
array elements of each argument in order.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let A be UNDEFINED.

4.  If O is an exotic Array object, then

    a.  Let C be Get(O, "CONSTRUCTOR").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(C).

    c.  If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

        i.  Let thisRealm be the running execution context’s Realm.

        ii. If SameValue(thisRealm and GetFunctionRealm(C)) is TRUE,
            then

            1.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]]
                internal method of C with argument (0).

5.  If A is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let A be ArrayCreate(0).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

7.  Let n be 0.

8.  Let items be a List whose first element is O and whose
    subsequent elements are, in left to right order, the arguments that
    were passed to this function invocation.

9.  Repeat, while items is not empty

    a.  Remove the first element from items and let E be the value
        of the element.

    b.  Let spreadable be IsConcatSpreadable(E).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(spreadable).

    d.  If spreadable is TRUE, then

        i.  Let k be 0.

        ii. Let lenVal be Get(E, "LENGTH").

        iii. Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

        v.  Repeat, while k < len

            1.  Let P be ToString(k).

            2.  Let exists be HasProperty(E, P).

            3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(exists).

            4.  If exists is TRUE, then

                a.  Let subElement be Get(E, P).

                b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(subElement).

                c.  Let status be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow (A,
                    ToString(n), subElement).

                d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

            5.  Increase n by 1.

            6.  Increase k by 1.

    e.  Else E is added as a single item rather than spread,

        i.  Let status be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow (A,
            ToString(n), E).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

        iii. Increase n by 1.

10. Let putStatus be Put(A, "LENGTH", n, TRUE).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

12. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the CONCAT method is 1.

NOTE 1 The explicit setting of the LENGTH property in step 10 is
necessary to ensure that its value is correct in situations where the
trailing elements of the result Array are not present.

NOTE 2 The CONCAT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

IsConcatSpreadable ( O ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation IsConcatSpreadable with argument O performs the
following steps:

1.  If Type(O) is not Object, then return FALSE.

2.  Let spreadable be Get(O, @@isConcatSpreadable).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(spreadable).

4.  If spreadable is not UNDEFINED, then return
    ToBoolean(spreadable).

5.  If O is an exotic Array object, then return TRUE.

6.  Return FALSE.

Array.prototype.constructor

The initial value of ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the standard
built-in ARRAY constructor.

Array.prototype.copyWithin (target, start [ , end ] )

The COPYWITHIN method takes up to three arguments target, start and
end.

NOTE The end argument is optional with the length of the THIS object
as its default value. If target is negative, it is treated as
length_+_target where length is the length of the array. If start
is negative, it is treated as length_+_start. If end is negative, it
is treated as length_+_end.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

    relativeTarget),0); else let to be min(relativeTarget, len).

9.  Let relativeStart be ToInteger(start).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeStart).

11. If relativeStart is negative, let from be max((len +
    relativeStart),0); else let from be min(relativeStart, len).

12. If end is UNDEFINED, let relativeEnd be len; else let
    relativeEnd be ToInteger(end).

13. ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeEnd).

14. If relativeEnd is negative, let final be max((len +
    relativeEnd),0); else let final be min(relativeEnd, len).

15. Let count be min(final_-_from, len_-_to).

16. If from_<_to and to_<_from_+_count

    a.  Let direction = -1.

    b.  Let from = from + count -1.

    c.  Let to = to + count -1.

17. Else,

    a.  Let direction = 1.

18. Repeat, while count > 0

    a.  Let fromKey be ToString(from).

    b.  Let toKey be ToString(to).

    c.  Let fromPresent be HasProperty(O, fromKey).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(fromPresent).

    e.  If fromPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let fromVal be Get(O, fromKey).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(fromVal).

        iii. Let putStatus be Put(O, toKey, fromVal, TRUE).

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

    f.  Else fromPresent is FALSE,

        i.  Let deleteStatus be DeletePropertyOrThrow(O, toKey).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(deleteStatus).

    g.  Let from be from + direction.

    h.  Let to be to + direction.

    i.  Let count be count − 1.

19. Return O.

The LENGTH property of the COPYWITHIN method is 2.

NOTE 1 The COPYWITHIN function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.entries ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject with the THIS value as its
    argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Return CreateArrayIterator(O, "KEY+VALUE").

Array.prototype.every ( callbackfn [ , thisArg] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments and
returns a value that is coercible to the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE.
EVERY calls callbackfn once for each element present in the array, in
ascending order, until it finds one where callbackfn returns FALSE. If
such an element is found, EVERY immediately returns FALSE. Otherwise, if
callbackfn returned TRUE for all elements, EVERY will return TRUE.
callbackfn is called only for elements of the array which actually
exist; it is not called for missing elements of the array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

EVERY does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by EVERY is set before the first call to
callbackfn. Elements which are appended to the array after the call to
EVERY begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing elements
of the array are changed, their value as passed to callbackfn will be
the value at the time EVERY visits them; elements that are deleted after
the call to EVERY begins and before being visited are not visited. EVERY
acts like the "for all" quantifier in mathematics. In particular, for an
empty array, it returns TRUE.

When the EVERY method is called with one or two arguments, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH")

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(callbackfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Let k be 0.

9.  Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let testResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(testResult).

        v.  If ToBoolean(testResult) is FALSE, return FALSE.

    e.  Increase k by 1.

10. Return TRUE.

The LENGTH property of the EVERY method is 1.

NOTE The EVERY function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.fill (value [ , start [ , end ] ] )

The FILL method takes up to three arguments value, start and end.

NOTE The start and end arguments are optional with default values of
0 and the length of the THIS object. If start is negative, it is
treated as length_+_start where length is the length of the array.
If end is negative, it is treated as length_+_end.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  Let relativeStart be ToInteger(start).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeStart).

8.  If relativeStart is negative, let k be max((len +
    relativeStart),0); else let k be min(relativeStart, len).

9.  If end is UNDEFINED, let relativeEnd be len; else let
    relativeEnd be ToInteger(end).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeEnd).

11. If relativeEnd is negative, let final be max((len +
    relativeEnd),0); else let final be min(relativeEnd, len).

12. Repeat, while k < final

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let putStatus be Put(O, Pk, value, TRUE).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

    d.  Increase k by 1.

13. Return O.

The LENGTH property of the FILL method is 1.

NOTE 1 The FILL function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.filter ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments and
returns a value that is coercible to the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE.
FILTER calls callbackfn once for each element in the array, in
ascending order, and constructs a new array of all the values for which
callbackfn returns TRUE. callbackfn is called only for elements of
the array which actually exist; it is not called for missing elements of
the array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

FILTER does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by FILTER is set before the first call
to callbackfn. Elements which are appended to the array after the call
to FILTER begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing
elements of the array are changed their value as passed to callbackfn
will be the value at the time FILTER visits them; elements that are
deleted after the call to FILTER begins and before being visited are not
visited.

When the FILTER method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(callbackfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Let A be UNDEFINED.

9.  If O is an exotic Array object, then

    a.  Let C be Get(O, "CONSTRUCTOR").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(C).

    c.  If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

        i.  Let thisRealm be the running execution context’s Realm.

        ii. If SameValue(thisRealm and GetFunctionRealm(C)) is TRUE,
            then

            1.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]]
                internal method of C with an argument list containing
                the single item 0.

10. If A is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let A be ArrayCreate(0).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

12. Let k be 0.

13. Let to be 0.

14. Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let selected be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(selected).

        v.  If ToBoolean(selected) is TRUE, then

            1.  Let status be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow (A,
                ToString(to), kValue).

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

            3.  Increase to by 1.

    e.  Increase k by 1.

15. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the FILTER method is 1.

NOTE The FILTER function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.find ( predicate [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE predicate should be a function that accepts three arguments and
returns a value that is coercible to the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE.
FIND calls predicate once for each element present in the array, in
ascending order, until it finds one where predicate returns TRUE. If
such an element is found, FIND immediately returns that element value.
Otherwise, FIND returns UNDEFINED. predicate is called only for
elements of the array which actually exist; it is not called for missing
elements of the array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of predicate. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

predicate is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

FIND does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to predicate.

The range of elements processed by FIND is set before the first call to
callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the call to
FIND begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing elements of
the array are changed, their value as passed to predicate will be the
value at the time that FIND visits them; elements that are deleted after
the call to FIND begins and before being visited are not visited.

When the FIND method is called with one or two arguments, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(predicate) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let testResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of predicate with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(testResult).

        v.  If ToBoolean(testResult) is TRUE, return kValue.

    e.  Increase k by 1.

10. Return UNDEFINED.

The LENGTH property of the FIND method is 1.

NOTE The FIND function is intentionally generic; it does not require

Array.prototype.findIndex ( predicate [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE predicate should be a function that accepts three arguments and
returns a value that is coercible to the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE.
FINDINDEX calls predicate once for each element present in the array,
in ascending order, until it finds one where predicate returns TRUE.
If such an element is found, FINDINDEX immediately returns the index of
that element value. Otherwise, FINDINDEX returns -1. predicate is
called only for elements of the array which actually exist; it is not
called for missing elements of the array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of predicate. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

predicate is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

FINDINDEX does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but
the object may be mutated by the calls to predicate.

The range of elements processed by FINDINDEX is set before the first
call to callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the
call to FINDINDEX begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If
existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to
predicate will be the value at the time that FINDINDEX visits them;
elements that are deleted after the call to FINDINDEX begins and before
being visited are not visited.

When the FINDINDEX method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(predicate) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Let k be 0.

9.  Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let testResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of predicate with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(testResult).

        v.  If ToBoolean(testResult) is TRUE, return k.

    e.  Increase k by 1.

10. Return -1.

The LENGTH property of the FINDINDEX method is 1.

NOTE The FINDINDEX function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.forEach ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments.
FOREACH calls callbackfn once for each element present in the array,
in ascending order. callbackfn is called only for elements of the
array which actually exist; it is not called for missing elements of the
array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

FOREACH does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but
the object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by FOREACH is set before the first call
to callbackfn. Elements which are appended to the array after the call
to FOREACH begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing
elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to callback
will be the value at the time FOREACH visits them; elements that are
deleted after the call to FOREACH begins and before being visited are
not visited.

When the FOREACH method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(callbackfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Let k be 0.

9.  Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let funcResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(funcResult).

    e.  Increase k by 1.

10. Return UNDEFINED.

The LENGTH property of the FOREACH method is 1.

NOTE The FOREACH function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.indexOf ( searchElement [ , fromIndex ] )

NOTE INDEXOF compares searchElement to the elements of the array, in
ascending order, using the Strict Equality Comparison algorithm
(7.2.11), and if found at one or more positions, returns the index of
the first such position; otherwise, −1is returned.

The optional second argument fromIndex defaults to 0 (i.e. the whole
array is searched). If it is greater than or equal to the length of the
array, −1is returned, i.e. the array will not be searched. If it is
negative, it is used as the offset from the end of the array to compute
fromIndex. If the computed index is less than 0, the whole array will
be searched.

When the INDEXOF method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH")

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If len is 0, return −1.

7.  If argument fromIndex was passed let n be
    ToInteger(fromIndex); else let n be 0.

8.  ReturnIfAbrupt(n).

9.  If n ≥ len, return −1.

10. If n ≥ 0, then

    a.  Let k be n.

11. Else n<0,

    a.  Let k be len - abs(n).

    b.  If k < 0, then let k be 0.

12. Repeat, while k_<_len

    a.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, ToString(k)).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    c.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let elementK be the result of Get(O, ToString(k)).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(elementK).

        iii. Let same be the result of performing Strict Equality
            Comparison searchElement === elementK.

        iv. If same is TRUE, return k.

    d.  Increase k by 1.

13. Return -1.

The LENGTH property of the INDEXOF method is 1.

NOTE The INDEXOF function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.join (separator)

NOTE The elements of the array are converted to Strings, and these
Strings are then concatenated, separated by occurrences of the
separator. If no separator is provided, a single comma is used as the
separator.

The JOIN method takes one argument, separator, and performs the
following steps:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be the result of Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If separator is UNDEFINED, let separator be the single-element
    String ",".

7.  Let sep be ToString(separator).

8.  If len is zero, return the empty String.

9.  Let element0 be the result of Get(O, "0").

10. If element0 is UNDEFINED or NULL, let R be the empty String;
    otherwise, let R be ToString(element0).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(R).

12. Let k be 1.

13. Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let S be the String value produced by concatenating R and
        sep.

    b.  Let element be Get(O, ToString(k)).

    c.  If element is UNDEFINED or NULL, then let next be the empty
        String; otherwise, let next be ToString(element).

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

    e.  Let R be a String value produced by concatenating S and
        next.

    f.  Increase k by 1.

    argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Return CreateArrayIterator(O, "KEY").

Array.prototype.lastIndexOf ( searchElement [ , fromIndex ] )

NOTE LASTINDEXOF compares searchElement to the elements of the array
in descending order using the Strict Equality Comparison algorithm
(7.2.11), and if found at one or more positions, returns the index of
the last such position; otherwise, −1is returned.

The optional second argument fromIndex defaults to the array's length
minus one (i.e. the whole array is searched). If it is greater than or
equal to the length of the array, the whole array will be searched. If
it is negative, it is used as the offset from the end of the array to
compute fromIndex. If the computed index is less than 0, −1is
returned.

When the LASTINDEXOF method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH")

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

9.  If n ≥ 0, then let k be min(n, len – 1).

10. Else n < 0,

    a.  Let k be len - abs(n).

11. Repeat, while k≥ 0

Array.prototype.map ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments. MAP
calls callbackfn once for each element in the array, in ascending
order, and constructs a new Array from the results. callbackfn is
called only for elements of the array which actually exist; it is not
called for missing elements of the array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

MAP does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by MAP is set before the first call to

Array.prototype.reduce ( callbackfn [ , initialValue ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that takes four arguments. REDUCE
calls the callback, as a function, once for each element present in the
array, in ascending order.

callbackfn is called with four arguments: the previousValue (or
value from the previous call to callbackfn), the currentValue (value
of the current element), the currentIndex, and the object being
traversed. The first time that callback is called, the previousValue
and currentValue can be one of two values. If an initialValue was
provided in the call to REDUCE, then previousValue will be equal to
initialValue and currentValue will be equal to the first value in
the array. If no initialValue was provided, then previousValue will
be equal to the first value in the array and currentValue will be
equal to the second. It is a TYPEERROR if the array contains no elements
and initialValue is not provided.

REDUCE does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by REDUCE is set before the first call
to callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the call
to REDUCE begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing

Array.prototype.reduceRight ( callbackfn [ , initialValue ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that takes four arguments.
REDUCERIGHT calls the callback, as a function, once for each element
present in the array, in descending order.

callbackfn is called with four arguments: the previousValue (or
value from the previous call to callbackfn), the currentValue (value
of the current element), the currentIndex, and the object being
traversed. The first time the function is called, the previousValue
and currentValue can be one of two values. If an initialValue was
provided in the call to REDUCERIGHT, then previousValue will be equal
to initialValue and currentValue will be equal to the last value in
the array. If no initialValue was provided, then previousValue will
be equal to the last value in the array and currentValue will be equal
to the second-to-last value. It is a TYPEERROR if the array contains no
elements and initialValue is not provided.

REDUCERIGHT does not directly mutate the object on which it is called
but the object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by REDUCERIGHT is set before the first
call to callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the
call to REDUCERIGHT begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If
existing elements of the array are changed by callbackfn, their value
as passed to callbackfn will be the value at the time REDUCERIGHT
visits them; elements that are deleted after the call to REDUCERIGHT
begins and before being visited are not visited.

NOTE The REVERSE function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.shift ( )

NOTE The first element of the array is removed from the array and
returned.

When the SHIFT method is called the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

12. ReturnIfAbrupt(deleteStatus).

13. Let putStatus be Put(O, "LENGTH", len–1, TRUE).

14. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

15. Return first.

NOTE The SHIFT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.slice (start, end)

NOTE The SLICE method takes two arguments, start and end, and
returns an array containing the elements of the array from element
start up to, but not including, element end (or through the end of
the array if end is UNDEFINED). If start is negative, it is treated
as length_+_start where length is the length of the array. If end
is negative, it is treated as length_+_end where length is the
length of the array.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

    relativeEnd be ToInteger(end).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeEnd).

11. If relativeEnd is negative, let final be max((len +
    relativeEnd),0); else let final be min(relativeEnd, len).

12. Let count be max(final – k, 0).

13. Let A be UNDEFINED.

14. If O is an exotic Array object, then

    a.  Let C be Get(O, "CONSTRUCTOR").

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(C).

    c.  If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

        i.  Let thisRealm be the running execution context’s Realm.

        ii. If SameValue(thisRealm and GetFunctionRealm(C)) is TRUE,
            then

            1.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]]
                internal method of C with argument (count).

15. If A is UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let A be ArrayCreate(count).

16. ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

17. Let n be 0.

18. Repeat, while k < final

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let status be CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(A,
            ToString(n), kValue ).

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

    e.  Increase k by 1.

    f.  Increase n by 1.

19. Let putStatus be Put(A, "LENGTH", n, TRUE).

20. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

21. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the SLICE method is 2.

NOTE 1 The explicit setting of the LENGTH property of the result Array
in step 19 is necessary to ensure that its value is correct in
situations where the trailing elements of the result Array are not
present.

NOTE 2 The SLICE function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.some ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments and
returns a value that is coercible to the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE.
SOME calls callbackfn once for each element present in the array, in
ascending order, until it finds one where callbackfn returns TRUE. If
such an element is found, SOME immediately returns TRUE. Otherwise, SOME
returns FALSE. callbackfn is called only for elements of the array
which actually exist; it is not called for missing elements of the
array.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the element,
the index of the element, and the object being traversed.

SOME does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the
object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

The range of elements processed by SOME is set before the first call to
callbackfn. Elements that are appended to the array after the call to
SOME begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing elements of
the array are changed, their value as passed to callbackfn will be the
value at the time that SOME visits them; elements that are deleted after
the call to SOME begins and before being visited are not visited. SOME
acts like the "exists" quantifier in mathematics. In particular, for an
empty array, it returns FALSE.

When the SOME method is called with one or two arguments, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenValue be Get(O, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  If IsCallable(callbackfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Let k be 0.

9.  Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let Pk be ToString(k).

    b.  Let kPresent be HasProperty(O, Pk).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(kPresent).

    d.  If kPresent is TRUE, then

        i.  Let kValue be Get(O, Pk).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(kValue).

        iii. Let testResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing kValue, k, and O as
            argumentsList.

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(testResult).

        v.  If ToBoolean(testResult) is TRUE, return TRUE.

    e.  Increase k by 1.

10. Return FALSE.

The LENGTH property of the SOME method is 1.

NOTE The SOME function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.sort (comparefn)

The elements of this array are sorted. The sort is not necessarily
stable (that is, elements that compare equal do not necessarily remain
in their original order). If comparefn is not UNDEFINED, it should be
a function that accepts two arguments x and y and returns a negative
value if x < y, zero if x = y, or a positive value if x > y.

Upon entry, the following steps are performed to initialize evaluation
of the SORT function:

1.  Let obj be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value
    as the argument.

2.  Let lenValue be Get(obj, "LENGTH").

3.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

The result of the SORT function is then determined as follows:

If comparefn is not UNDEFINED and is not a consistent comparison
function for the elements of this array (see below), the behaviour of
SORT is implementation-defined.

Let proto be the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal
method of obj. If proto is not NULL and there exists an integer j
such that all of the conditions below are satisfied then the behaviour
of SORT is implementation-defined:

-   obj is sparse (22.1)

-   0 ≤ j < len

-   The result of HasProperty(proto, ToString(j)) is TRUE.

The behaviour of SORT is also implementation defined if obj is sparse
and any of the following conditions are true:

-   The result of the predicate IsExtensible(obj) is FALSE.

-   Any array index property of obj whose name is a nonnegative
    integer less than len is a data property whose [[Configurable]]
    attribute is FALSE.

The behaviour of SORT is also implementation defined if any array index
property of obj whose name is a nonnegative integer less than len is
an accessor property or is a data property whose [[Writable]] attribute
is FALSE.

Otherwise, the following steps are taken:

1.  Perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the [[Get]]
    and [[Set]] internal methods of obj, to the DeletePropertyOrThrow
    abstract operation with obj as the first argument, and to
    SortCompare (described below), where the property key argument for
    each call to [[Get]], [[Set]], or DeletePropertyOrThrow is the
    string representation of a nonnegative integer less than len and
    where the arguments for calls to SortCompare are results of previous
    calls to the [[Get]] internal method. If obj is not sparse then
    DeletePropertyOrThrow must not be called. If any [[Set]] call
    returns FALSE a TYPEERROR exception is thrown. If an abrupt
    completion is returned from any of these operations, it is
    immediately returned as the value of this function.

2.  Return obj.

The returned object must have the following two characteristics:

-   There must be some mathematical permutation π of the nonnegative
    integers less than len, such that for every nonnegative integer
    j less than len, if property old[j] existed, then new[π(j)]
    is exactly the same value as old[j],. But if property old[j] did
    not exist, then new[π(j)] does not exist.

-   Then for all nonnegative integers j and k, each less than len,
    if SortCompare(j_,_k) < 0 (see SortCompare below), then Π(j) <
    Π(k).

Here the notation old[j] is used to refer to the hypothetical result
of calling the [[Get]] internal method of obj with argument j before
this function is executed, and the notation new[j] to refer to the
hypothetical result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of obj with
argument j after this function has been executed.

A function comparefn is a consistent comparison function for a set of
values S if all of the requirements below are met for all values a,
b, and c (possibly the same value) in the set S: The notation
a_ <~CF~ _b means comparefn_(_a_,_b) < 0; a_ =~CF~ _b means
comparefn_(_a_,_b) = 0 (of either sign); and a_ >~CF~ _b means
comparefn_(_a_,_b) > 0.

-   Calling comparefn_(_a_,_b) always returns the same value v when
    given a specific pair of values a and b as its two arguments.
    Furthermore, Type(v) is Number, and v is not NaN. Note that this
    implies that exactly one of a_ <~CF~ _b, a_ =~CF~ _b, and
    a_ >~CF~ _b will be true for a given pair of a and b.

-   Calling comparefn_(_a_,_b) does not modify obj.

-   a_ =~CF~ _a (reflexivity)

-   If a_ =~CF~ _b, then b_ =~CF~ _a (symmetry)

-   If a_ =~CF~ _b and b_ =~CF~ _c, then a_ =~CF~ _c (transitivity
    of =~CF~)

-   If a_ <~CF~ _b and b_ <~CF~ _c, then a_ <~CF~ _c (transitivity
    of <~CF~)

-   If a_ >~CF~ _b and b_ >~CF~ _c, then a_ >~CF~ _c (transitivity
    of >~CF~)

NOTE 1 The above conditions are necessary and sufficient to ensure that
comparefn divides the set S into equivalence classes and that these
equivalence classes are totally ordered.

NOTE 2 The SORT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore, it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Runtime Semantics: SortCompare Abstract Operation

When the SortCompare abstract operation is called with two arguments j
and k, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let jString be ToString(j).

2.  Let kString be ToString(k).

3.  Let hasj be HasProperty(obj, jString).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(hasj).

5.  Let hask be HasProperty(obj, kString).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(hask).

7.  If hasj and hask are both FALSE, then return +0.

8.  If hasj is FALSE, then return 1.

9.  If hask is FALSE, then return –1.

10. Let x be Get(obj_,_jString).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

12. Let y be Get(obj, kString).

13. ReturnIfAbrupt(y).

14. If x and y are both UNDEFINED, return +0.

15. If x is UNDEFINED, return 1.

16. If y is UNDEFINED, return −1.

17. If the argument comparefn is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If IsCallable(comparefn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR
        exception.

    b.  Let v be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
        comparefn passing UNDEFINED as thisArgument and with a List
        containing the values of x and y as the argumentsList.

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(v).

    d.  If v is NAN, then return +0.

    e.  Return v.

18. Let xString be ToString(x).

19. ReturnIfAbrupt(xString).

20. Let yString be ToString(y).

21. ReturnIfAbrupt(yString).

22. If xString < yString, return −1.

23. If xString > yString, return 1.

24. Return +0.

NOTE Because non-existent property values always compare greater than
UNDEFINED property values, and UNDEFINED always compares greater than
any other value, UNDEFINED property values always sort to the end of the
result, followed by non-existent property values.

Array.prototype.splice (start, deleteCount , ...items )

NOTE When the SPLICE method is called with two or more arguments
start, deleteCount and zero or more items,., the deleteCount
elements of the array starting at integer index start are replaced by
the arguments items,. An Array object containing the deleted elements
(if any) is returned.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH")

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  Let relativeStart be ToInteger(start).

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeStart).

8.  If relativeStart is negative, let actualStart be max((len +

    len).

9.  If the number of actual arguments is 0, then

    a.  Let actualDeleteCount be 0.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(dc).

    c.  Let actualDeleteCount be min(max(dc,0), len –

            then

            1.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]]

19. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

20. Let items be a List whose elements are, in left to right order,
    the portion of the actual argument list starting with the third
    argument. The list will be empty fewer than three arguments were
    passed.

21. Let itemCount be the number of elements in items.

28. Return A.

The LENGTH property of the SPLICE method is 2.

NOTE 1 The explicit setting of the LENGTH property of the result Array
in step 18 is necessary to ensure that its value is correct in
situations where its trailing elements are not present.

NOTE 2 The SPLICE function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.toLocaleString ( [ reserved1 [ , reserved2 ] ] )

An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402
Internationalization API must implement the
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.TOLOCALESTRING method as specified in the ECMA-402
specification. If an ECMAScript implementation does not include the
ECMA-402 API the following specification of the TOLOCALESTRING method is
used.

NOTE The first edition of ECMA-402 did not include a replacement
specification for the ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.TOLOCALESTRING method.

The meanings of the optional parameters to this method are defined in
the ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402
support must not use those parameter positions for anything else.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let array be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value
    as the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(array).

3.  Let arrayLen be Get(array, "LENGTH").

4.  Let len be ToLength(arrayLen).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  Let separator be the String value for the list-separator String
    appropriate for the host environment’s current locale (this is
    derived in an implementation-defined way).

7.  If len is zero, return the empty String.

8.  Let firstElement be Get(array, "0").

9.  ReturnIfAbrupt(firstElement).

10. If firstElement is UNDEFINED or NULL, then

    a.  Let R be the empty String.

11. Else

    a.  Let R be Invoke(firstElement, "TOLOCALESTRING").

    b.  Let R be ToString(R).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(R).

12. Let k be 1.

13. Repeat, while k < len

    a.  Let S be a String value produced by concatenating R and
        separator.

    b.  Let nextElement be Get(array, ToString(k)).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextElement).

    d.  If nextElement is UNDEFINED or NULL, then

        i.  Let R be the empty String.

    e.  Else

        i.  Let R be Invoke(nextElement, "TOLOCALESTRING").

        ii. Let R be ToString(R).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(R).

    f.  Let R be a String value produced by concatenating S and R.

    g.  Increase k by 1.

14. Return R.

NOTE 1 The elements of the array are converted to Strings using their
TOLOCALESTRING methods, and these Strings are then concatenated,
separated by occurrences of a separator String that has been derived in
an implementation-defined locale-specific way. The result of calling
this function is intended to be analogous to the result of TOSTRING,
except that the result of this function is intended to be
locale-specific.

NOTE 2 The TOLOCALESTRING function is intentionally generic; it does not
require that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be
transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.toString ( )

When the TOSTRING method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let array be the result of calling ToObject on the THIS value.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(array).

3.  Let func be Get(array, "JOIN").

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(func).

5.  If IsCallable(func) is FALSE, then let func be the intrinsic
    function %ObjProto_toString% (19.1.3.6).

6.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func
    providing array as thisArgument and an empty List as
    argumentsList.

NOTE The TOSTRING function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.unshift ( ...items )

NOTE The arguments are prepended to the start of the array, such that
their order within the array is the same as the order in which they
appear in the argument list.

When the UNSHIFT method is called with zero or more arguments item1,
item2, etc., the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Let lenVal be Get(O, "LENGTH")

4.  Let len be ToLength(lenVal).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

6.  Let argCount be the number of actual arguments.

7.  If argCount > 0, then

    a.  Let k be len.

    b.  Repeat, while k > 0,

        i.  Let from be ToString(k–1).

        ii. Let to be ToString(k_+_argCount –1).

        iii. Let fromPresent be HasProperty(O, from).

        iv. ReturnIfAbrupt(fromPresent).

        v.  If fromPresent is TRUE, then

            1.  Let fromValue be the result of Get(O, from).

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(fromValue).

            3.  Let putStatus be Put(O, to, fromValue, TRUE).

            4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

        vi. Else fromPresent is FALSE,

            1.  Let deleteStatus be DeletePropertyOrThrow(O, to).

            2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(deleteStatus).

        vii. Decrease k by 1.

    c.  Let j be 0.

    d.  Let items be a List whose elements are, in left to right
        order, the arguments that were passed to this function
        invocation.

    e.  Repeat, while items is not empty

        i.  Remove the first element from items and let E be the
            value of that element.

        ii. Let putStatus be Put(O, ToString(j), E, TRUE).

        iii. ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

        iv. Increase j by 1.

8.  Let putStatus be Put(O, "LENGTH", len_+_argCount, TRUE).

9.  ReturnIfAbrupt(putStatus).

10. Return len_+_argCount.

The LENGTH property of the UNSHIFT method is 1.

NOTE The UNSHIFT function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

Array.prototype.values ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject with the THIS value as its
    argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Return CreateArrayIterator(O, "VALUE").

This function is the %ArrayProto_values% intrinsic object.

Array.prototype [ @@iterator ] ( )

The initial value of the @@iterator property is the same function object
as the initial value of the ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.VALUES property.

Array.prototype [ @@unscopables ]

The initial value of the @@unscopables data property is an object
created by the following steps:

1.  Let blackList be ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%).

2.  Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "COPYWITHIN", TRUE).

3.  Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "ENTRIES", TRUE).

4.  Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "FILL", TRUE).

5.  Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "FIND", TRUE).

6.  Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "FINDINDEX", TRUE).

7.  8.  9.  10. Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "KEYS", TRUE).

11. Perform CreateDataProperty(blackList, "VALUES", TRUE).

12. Assert: Each of the above calls will return TRUE.

13. Return blackList.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE The own property names of this object are property names that were
not included as standard properties of ARRAY.PROTOTYPE prior to the
sixth edition of this specification. These names are ignored for WITH
statement binding purposes in order to preserve the behaviour of
existing code that might use one of these names as a binding in an outer
scope that is shadowed by a WITH statement whose binding object is an
Array object.

Properties of Array Instances

Array instances are exotic Array objects and have the internal methods
specified for such objects. Array instances inherit properties from the
Array prototype object. Array instances also have an
[[ArrayInitializationState]] internal slot.

Array instances have a LENGTH property, and a set of enumerable
properties with array index names.

length

The LENGTH property of this Array object is a data property whose value
is always numerically greater than the name of every deletable property
whose name is an array index.

The LENGTH property initially has the attributes { [[Writable]]: TRUE,
[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

NOTE Attempting to set the length property of an Array object to a value
that is numerically less than or equal to the largest numeric property
name of an existing array indexed non-deletable property of the array
will result in the length being set to a numeric value that is one
greater than that largest numeric property name. See 9.4.2.1.

Array Iterator Objects 

An Array Iterator is an object, that represents a specific iteration
over some specific Array instance object. There is not a named
constructor for Array Iterator objects. Instead, Array iterator objects
are created by calling certain methods of Array instance objects.

CreateArrayIterator Abstract Operation

Several methods of Array objects return Iterator objects. The abstract
operation CreateArrayIterator with arguments array and kind is used
to create such iterator objects. It performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(array) is Object.

2.  3.  Let iterator be ObjectCreate(%ArrayIteratorPrototype%,
    ([[IteratedObject]], [[ArrayIteratorNextIndex]],
    [[ArrayIterationKind]])).

4.  Set iterator’s [[IteratedObject]] internal slot to array.

5.  Set iterator’s [[ArrayIteratorNextIndex]] internal slot to 0.

6.  Set iterator’s [[ArrayIterationKind]] internal slot to kind.

7.  Return iterator.

The %ArrayIteratorPrototype% Object

All Array Iterator Objects inherit properties from the
%ArrayIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. The %ArrayIteratorPrototype%
object is an ordinary object and its [[Prototype]] internal slot is the
%ObjectPrototype% intrinsic object. In addition,
%ArrayIteratorPrototype% has the following properties:

%ArrayIteratorPrototype%. next( )

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If O does not have all of the internal slots of an Array Iterator
    Instance (22.1.5.3), throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Let a be the value of the [[IteratedObject]] internal slot of O.

5.  If a is UNDEFINED, then return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED,
    TRUE).

6.  Let index be the value of the [[ArrayIteratorNextIndex]] internal
    slot of O.

7.  Let itemKind be the value of the [[ArrayIterationKind]] internal
    slot of O.

8.  Let lenValue be Get(a, "LENGTH").

9.  Let len be ToLength(lenValue).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(len).

11. If index ≥ len, then

    a.  Set the value of the [[IteratedObject]] internal slot of O to
        UNDEFINED.

    b.  Return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED, TRUE).

12. Set the value of the [[ArrayIteratorNextIndex]] internal slot of O
    to index+1.

13. If itemKind is "KEY", then let result be index.

14. Else,

    a.  Let elementKey be ToString(index).

    b.  Let elementValue be Get(a, elementKey).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(elementValue).

15. If itemKind is "VALUE", then let result be elementValue.

16. Else,

    a.  Assert itemKind is "KEY+VALUE",.

    b.  Let result be ArrayCreate(2).

    c.  Assert: result is a new, well-formed Array object so the
        following operations will never fail.

    d.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "0", index).

    e.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "1", elementValue).

    f.  

17. 18. 19. Return CreateIterResultObject(result, FALSE).

%ArrayIteratorPrototype% [ @@iterator ] ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Return the THIS value.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.ITERATOR]".

%ArrayIteratorPrototype% [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"ARRAY ITERATOR".

Properties of Array Iterator Instances

Array Iterator instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties
from the %ArrayIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. Array Iterator
instances are initially created with the internal slots listed in Table
44.

Table 44 — Internal Slots of Array Iterator Instances

  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INTERNAL SLOT                DESCRIPTION
  [[IteratedObject]]           The object whose array elements are being iterated.
  [[ArrayIteratorNextIndex]]   The integer index of the next array index to be examined by this iteration.
  [[ArrayIterationKind]]       A string value that identifies what is to be returned for each element of the iteration. The possible values are: "KEY", "VALUE", "KEY+VALUE".
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TypedArray Objects 

TypedArray objects present an array-like view of an underlying binary
data buffer (24.1). Each element of a TypedArray instance has the same
underlying binary scalar data type. There is a distinct TypedArray
constructor, listed in Table 45, for each of the nine supported element
types. Each constructor in Table 45 has a corresponding distinct
prototype object.

In the definitions below, references to TypedArray should be replaced
with the appropriate constructor name from the above table. The phrase
“the element size in bytes” refers to the value in the Element Size
column of the table in the row corresponding to the constructor. The
phrase “element Type” refers to the value in the Element Type column for
that row.

The %TypedArray% Intrinsic Object

The %TypedArray% intrinsic object is a constructor-like function object
that all of the TypedArray constructor object inherit from.
%TypedArray% and its corresponding prototype object provide common
properties that are inherited by all TypedArray constructors and their
instances. The %TypedArray% intrinsic does not have a global name or
appear as a property of the global object.

If the THIS value passed in the call is an Object with a
[[ViewedArrayBuffer]] internal slot whose value is UNDEFINED, it
initializes the THIS value using the argument values. This permits super
invocation of the TypedArray constructors by TypedArray subclasses.

The %TypedArray% intrinsic function object is designed to act as the
superclass of the various TypedArray constructors. Those constructors
use %TypedArray% to initialize their instances by invoking %TypedArray%
as if by making a SUPER call. The %TypedArray% intrinsic function is not
designed to be directly called in any other way. If %TypedArray% is
directly called or called as part of a NEW expression an exception is
thrown.

The actual behaviour of a SUPER call of %TypedArray% depends upon the
number and kind of arguments that are passed to it.

%TypedArray% ( all other argument combinations )

If the %TypedArray% function is called with arguments that do not match
any of the preceeding argument descriptions a TYPEERROR exception is
thrown.

Properties of the %TypedArray% Intrinsic Object

The %TypedArray% intrinsic object is a built-in function object. The
value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of %TypedArray% is the Function
prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides a LENGTH property whose value is 3 and a NAME property whose
value is "TYPEDARRAY", %TypedArray% has the following properties:

%TypedArray%.from ( source [ , mapfn [ , thisArg ] ] )

When the FROM method is called with argument source, and optional
arguments mapfn and thisArg, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let C be the THIS value.

2.  If IsConstructor(C) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let items be ToObject(source).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(items).

    UNDEFINED.

    a.  If IsCallable(f) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  If thisArg was supplied, let t be thisArg; else let t be
    UNDEFINED.

8.  Return TypedArrayFrom(C, UNDEFINED, items, f, t).

The LENGTH property of the FROM method is 1.

NOTE The FROM function is an intentionally generic factory method; it
does not require that its THIS value be a Typed Array constructor.
Therefore it can be transferred to or inherited by any other
constructors that may be called with a single numeric argument. This
function uses [[Put]] to store elements into a newly created object and
assume that the constructor sets the LENGTH property of the new object
to the argument value passed to it.

Runtime Semantics: TypedArrayFrom( constructor, target, items, mapfn, thisArg )

When the TypedArrayFrom abstract operation is called with arguments
constructor, target, items, mapfn, and thisArg, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let C be constructor.

2.  Assert: one of constructor and target is UNDEFINED.

3.  Assert: If constructor is not UNDEFINED, then IsConstructor(C)
    is TRUE.

4.  Assert: target is either UNDEFINED or an Object that has been
    validated by the %TypedArray% constructor as described in 22.2.1.3

5.  Assert: Type(items) is Object.

6.  Assert: Type(mapfn) is either a callable Object or Undefined.

7.  8.  If mapfn is UNDEFINED, then let mapping be FALSE.

9.  else

    a.  b.  Let T be thisArg.

    c.  Let mapping be TRUE

10. Let usingIterator be CheckIterable(items).

11. ReturnIfAbrupt(usingIterator).

12. If usingIterator is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let iterator be GetIterator(items, usingIterator).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(iterator).

    c.  Let values be a new empty List.

    d.  Let next be TRUE.

    e.  Repeat, while next is not FALSE

        i.  Let next be IteratorStep(iterator).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

    f.  If next is not FALSE, then

        i.  Let nextValue be IteratorValue(next).

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(nextValue).

        iii. Append nextValue to the end of the List values.

%TypedArray%.prototype.slice ( start, end )

The interpretation and use of the arguments of
%TypedArray%.PROTOTYPE.SLICE are the same as for ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SLICE
as defined in 22.1.3.22. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If O does not have a [[TypedArrayName]] internal slot, then throw
    a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Let buffer be the value of O’s [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] internal
    slot.

5.  If buffer is UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  If IsNeuteredBuffer(buffer) is TRUE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

7.  NOTE Side-effects of subsequent operations may still neuter
    buffer, but that will be detected by an accesses that are made to
    the content of buffer.

8.  Let len be the value of O’s [[ArrayLength]] internal slot.

9.  Let relativeStart be ToInteger(start).

10. ReturnIfAbrupt(relativeStart).

11. If relativeStart is negative, let k be max((len +
    relativeStart),0); else let k be min(relativeStart, len).

12. If end is UNDEFINED, let relativeEnd be len; else let
    relativeEnd be ToInteger(end).

    relativeEnd),0); else let final be min(relativeEnd, len).

15. Let count be max(final – k, 0).

16. Let C be Get(O, "CONSTRUCTOR").

17. ReturnIfAbrupt(C).

18. If IsConstructor(C) is TRUE, then

    a.  Let A be the result of calling the [[Construct]] internal
        method of C with argument (count).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(A).

This function is not generic. If the THIS value is not a object with a
[[TypedArrayName]] internal slot, a TYPEERROR exception is immediately
thrown when this function is called.

The LENGTH property of the SLICE method is 2.

%TypedArray%.prototype.some ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

%TypedArray%.PROTOTYPE.SOME is a distinct function that implements the
same algorithm as ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SOME as defined in 22.1.3.23 except
that the THIS object’s [[ArrayLength]] internal slot is accessed in
place of performing a [[Get]] of "LENGTH". The implementation of the
algorithm may be optimized with the knowledge that the THIS value is an
object that has a fixed length and whose integer indexed properties are
not sparse. However, such optimization must not introduce any observable
changes in the specified behaviour of the algorithm and must take into
account the possibility that calls to callbackfn may neuter the the
THIS value.

This function is not generic. If the THIS value is not a object with a
[[TypedArrayName]] internal slot, a TYPEERROR exception is immediately
thrown when this function is called. A TYPEERROR exception is also
immediately thrown if the THIS value’s [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] is
UNDEFINED or has been neutered.

The LENGTH property of the SOME method is 1.

%TypedArray%.prototype.sort ( comparefn )

%TypedArray%.PROTOTYPE.SORT is a distinct function that, except as
described below, implements the same requirements as those of
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SORT as defined in 22.1.3.24. The implementation of the
%TypedArray%.PROTOTYPE.SORT specification may be optimized with the
knowledge that the THIS value is an object that has a fixed length and
whose integer indexed properties are not sparse. The only internal
methods of the THIS object that the algorithm may call are [[Get]] and
[[Set]].

This function is not generic. If the THIS value is not a object with a
[[TypedArrayName]] internal slot, a TYPEERROR exception is immediately
thrown when it is called.

Upon entry, the following steps are performed to initialize evaluation
of the SORT function. These steps are used instead of the entry steps in
22.1.3.24:

1.  Let obj be the THIS value as the argument.

2.  If obj does not have a [[TypedArrayName]] internal slot, then
    throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let buffer be the value of O’s [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] internal
    slot.

4.  If buffer is UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If IsNeuteredBuffer(buffer) is TRUE, then throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

6.  Let len be the value of obj’s [[ArrayLength]] internal slot.

The following version of SortCompare is used by
%TypedArray%.PROTOTYPE.SORT. It performs a numeric comparison rather
than the string comparsion used in 22.1.3.24.

The Typed Array SortCompare abstract operation is called with two
arguments j and k, the following steps are taken:

1.  Let jString be ToString(j).

2.  Let kString be ToString(k).

3.  Let x be Get(obj_,_jString).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).

5.  Let y be the result of Get(obj, kString).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(y).

7.  Assert: Both Type(x) and Type(y) is Number.

8.  9.  10. 11. If the argument comparefn is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  If IsCallable(comparefn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR
        exception.

    b.  Let v be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
        comparefn passing UNDEFINED as thisArgument and with a List
        containing the values of x and y as the argumentsList.

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(v).

    d.  If v is NAN, then return +0.

    e.  Return v.

12. If x and y are both NAN, return +0.

13. If x is NAN, return 1.

14. If y is NAN, return −1.

15. If x < y, return −1.

16. If x > y, return 1.

17. Return +0.

NOTE 1 Because NAN always compares greater than any other value, NAN
property values always sort to the end of the result when a comparefn
is not provided.

%TypedArray%.prototype.subarray( [ begin [ , end ] ] )

Returns a new TypedArray object whose element types is the same as
this TypedArray and whose ArrayBuffer is the same as the ArrayBuffer
of this TypedArray, referencing the elements at begin, inclusive, up
to end, exclusive. If either begin or end is negative, it refers
to an index from the end of the array, as opposed to from the beginning.

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

The TypedArray Constructors

Each of these TypedArray constructor objects has the structure
described below, differing only in the name used as the constructor name
instead of TypedArray, in Table 45.

When a TypedArray constructor is called as a function rather than as a
constructor, it initializes a new TypedArray object. The THIS value
passed in the call must be an Object with a [[TypedArrayName]] internal
slot and a [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] internal slot whose value is UNDEFINED.
The constructor function initializes the THIS value using the argument
values.

The TypedArray constructors are designed to be subclassable. They may
be used as the value of an EXTENDS clause of a class declaration.
Subclass constructors that intended to inherit the specified
TypedArray behaviour must include a SUPER call to the TypedArray
constructor to initialize subclass instances.

TypedArray( ... argumentsList)

A TypedArray constructor with a list of arguments argumentsList
performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

8.  Let super be realmF.[[intrinsics]].[[%TypedArray%]].

9.  10. Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
    super with O and argumentsList as arguments.

new TypedArray( ... argumentsList)

A TypedArray constructor called as part of a new expression performs
the following steps:

1.  Let F be the TypedArray function object on which the NEW
    operator was applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return Construct(F, argumentsList).

Properties of the TypedArray Constructors

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of each TypedArray
constructor is the %TypedArray% intrinsic object (22.2.1).

Each TypedArray constructor has a NAME property whose value is the
String value of the constructor name specifried for it in Table 45.

Besides a LENGTH property (whose value is 3), each TypedArray
constructor has the following properties:

TypedArray_.BYTES_PERELEMENT

The value of TypedArray_.BYTES_PERELEMENT is the Number value of the
Element Size value specified in Table 45 for TypedArray.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

TypedArray.prototype

The initial value of TypedArray.prototype is the corresponding
TypedArray prototype object (22.2.6).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Properties of TypedArray Prototype Objects

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a TypedArray prototype
object is the standard built-in %TypedArrayPrototype% object (22.2.3). A
TypedArray prototype object is an ordinary object. It does not have a
[[ViewedArrayBuffer]] or or any other of the internal slots that are
specific to TypedArray instance objects.

TypedArray_.prototype.BYTES_PERELEMENT

The value of TypedArray_.prototype.BYTES_PERELEMENT is the Number
value of the Element Size value specified in Table 45 for TypedArray.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

TypedArray.prototype.constructor

The initial value of a TypedArray.prototype.constructor is the
corresponding standard built-in TypedArray constructor.

Properties of TypedArray Instances

TypedArray instances are Integer Indexed exotic objects. Each
TypedArray instances inherits properties from the corresponding
TypedArray prototype object. Each TypedArray instances have the
following internal slots: [[TypedArrayName]], [[ViewedArrayBuffer]],
[[ByteLength]], [[ByteOffset]], and [[ArrayLength]].



KEYED COLLECTION 


Map Objects

Map objects are collections of key/value pairs where both the keys and
values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A distinct key value
may only occur in one key/value pair within the Map’s collection.
Distinct key values are discriminated using the SameValueZero
comparision algorithm.

Map object must be implemented using either hash tables or other
mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on
the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in
this Map objects specification is only intended to describe the required
observable semantics of Map objects. It is not intended to be a viable
implementation model.

The Map Constructor 

The Map constructor is the %Map% intrinsic object and the initial value
of the MAP property of the global object. When MAP is called as a
function rather than as a constructor, it initializes its THIS value
with the internal state necessary to support the MAP.PROTOTYPE built-in
methods.

The MAP constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value in an EXTENDS clause of a class definition. Subclass
constructors that intend to inherit the specified MAP behaviour must
include a SUPER call to MAP.

Map ( [ iterable ] ) 

When the MAP function is called with optional argument the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let map be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(map) is not Object then, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If map does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If map’s [[MapData]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If iterable is not present, let iterable be UNDEFINED.

6.  If iterable is either UNDEFINED or NULL, then let iter be
    UNDEFINED.

7.  Else,

    a.  b.  c.  Let adder be the result of Get(map, "SET").

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(adder).

    e.  If IsCallable(adder) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR Exception.

    f.  Let iter be the result of GetIterator(iterable).

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(iter).

8.  If the value of map’s [[MapData]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED,
    then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

9.  Assert: map has not been reentrantly initialized.

10. Set map’s [[MapData]] internal slot to a new empty List.

11. If iter is UNDEFINED, then return map.

12. Repeat

    a.  Let next be the result of IteratorStep(iter).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

    c.  If next is FALSE, then return map.

    d.  Let nextItem be IteratorValue(next).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextItem).

    f.  If Type(nextItem) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR
        exception.

    g.  Let k be the result of Get(nextItem, "0").

    h.  ReturnIfAbrupt(k).

    i.  Let v be the result of Get(nextItem, "1").

    j.  ReturnIfAbrupt(v).

    k.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of adder with map as thisArgument and a List whose
        elements are k and v as argumentsList.

    l.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

NOTE If the parameter iterable is present, it is expected to be an
object that implements an @@iterator method that returns an iterator
object that produces a two element array-like object whose first element
is a value that will be used as a Map key and whose second element is
the value to associate with that key.

new Map ( ... argumentsList )

When MAP is called as part of a NEW expression it is a constructor: it
initializes a newly created object.

MAP called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the Map function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct(F, argumentsList).

If Map is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Map Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Map constructor is
the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Map constructor has
the following properties:

Map.prototype

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Map[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of a Map function object F performs the following
steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%MAPPROTOTYPE%", ([[MapData]])
    ).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of the Map Prototype Object

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Map prototype object
is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3). The Map
prototype object is an ordinary object. It does not have a [[MapData]]
internal slot.

Map.prototype.clear ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

3.  If M does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If M’s [[MapData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

    internal slot.

6.  Repeat for each Record {[[key]], [[value]]} p that is an element
    of entries,

    a.  Set p.[[key]] to empty.

    b.  Set p.[[value]] to empty.

7.  Return UNDEFINED.

NOTE The existing [[MapData]] List is preserved because there may be
existing MapIterator objects that are suspended midway through iterating
over that List.

Map.prototype.constructor

The initial value of MAP.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in MAP
constructor.

Map.prototype.delete ( key )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(M) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If M does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  Let entries be the List that is the value of M’s [[MapData]]
    internal slot.

    of entries,

    a.  If p.[[key]] is not empty and SameValueZero(p.[[key]],
        key) is TRUE, then

        i.  Set p.[[key]] to empty.

        ii. Set p.[[value]] to empty.

        iii. Return TRUE.

7.  Return FALSE.

NOTE The value EMPTY is used as a specification device to indicate that
an entry has been deleted. Actual implementations may take other actions
such as physically removing the entry from internal data structures.

Map.prototype.entries ( )

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

2.  Return the result of calling the CreateMapIterator abstract
    operation with arguments M and "KEY+VALUE".

Map.prototype.forEach ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments.
FOREACH calls callbackfn once for each key/value pair present in the
map object, in key insertion order. callbackfn is called only for keys
of the map which actually exist; it is not called for keys that have
been deleted from the map.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the value of the item, the
key of the item, and the Map object being traversed.

FOREACH does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but
the object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

When the FOREACH method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(M) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If M does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If M’s [[MapData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

        i.  Let funcResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing e.[[value]], e.[[key]], and M as
            argumentsList.

    internal slot.

6.  Repeat for each Record {[[key]], [[value]]} p that is an element
    of entries,

        key) is TRUE, then return TRUE.

7.  Return FALSE.

Map.prototype.keys ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

3.  If M does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

Properties of Map Instances

Map instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the Map
prototype. Map instances also have a [[MapData]] internal slot.

Map Iterator Objects 

A Map Iterator is an object, that represents a specific iteration over
some specific Map instance object. There is not a named constructor for
Map Iterator objects. Instead, map iterator objects are created by
calling certain methods of Map instance objects.

CreateMapIterator Abstract Operation

Several methods of Map objects return Iterator objects. The abstract
operation CreateMapIterator with arguments map and kind is used to
create such iterator objects. It performs the following steps:

1.  If Type(map) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  If map does not have a [[MapData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

3.  If the value of map’s [[MapData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then
    throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  Set iterator’s [[MapNextIndex]] internal slot to 0.

7.  Set iterator’s [[MapIterationKind]] internal slot to kind.

8.  Return iterator.

The %MapIteratorPrototype% Object

All Map Iterator Objects inherit properties from the
%MapIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. The %MapIteratorPrototype%
intrinsic object is an ordinary object and its [[Prototype]] internal
slot is the %ObjectPrototype% intrinsic object. In addition,
%MapIteratorPrototype% has the following properties:

%MapIteratorPrototype%.next ( )

    internal slot of m.

10. Repeat while index is less than the total number of elements of
    entries. The number of elements must be redetermined each time
    this method is evaluated.

        entries_[_index].

    b.  Set index to index+1;

                the following operations will never fail.

            4.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "0", e.[[key]]) .

            5.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "1", e.[[value]]).

Properties of Map Iterator Instances

Map Iterator instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from
the %MapIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. Map Iterator instances are
initially created with the internal slots described in Table 46.

Table 46 — Internal Slots of Map Iterator Instances

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INTERNAL SLOT          DESCRIPTION
  [[Map]]                The Map object that is being iterated.
  [[MapNextIndex]]       The integer index of the next Map data element to be examined by this iterator.
  [[MapIterationKind]]   A string value that identifies what is to be returned for each element of the iteration. The possible values are: "KEY", "VALUE", "KEY+VALUE".
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Set Objects

Set objects are collections of ECMAScript language values. A distinct
value may only occur once as an element of a Set’s collection. Distinct
values are discriminated using the SameValueZero comparision algorithm.

Set objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other
mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on
the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in
this Set objects specification is only intended to describe the required
observable semantics of Set objects. It is not intended to be a viable
implementation model.

The Set Constructor 

The Set constructor is the %Set% intrinsic object and the initial value
of the SET property of the global object. When SET is called as a
function rather than as a constructor, it initializes its THIS value
with the internal state necessary to support the SET.PROTOTYPE built-in
methods.

The SET constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
the value in an EXTENDS clause of a class definition. Subclass
constructors that intend to inherit the specified SET behaviour must
include a SUPER call to SET.

Set ( [ iterable ] )

When the SET function is called with optional argument iterable the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let set be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(set) is not Object then, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If set does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If set’s [[SetData]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If iterable is not present, let iterable be UNDEFINED.

6.  If iterable is either UNDEFINED or NULL, then let iter be
    UNDEFINED.

7.  Else,

    a.  b.  c.  Let adder be the result of Get(set, "ADD").

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(adder).

    e.  If IsCallable(adder) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR Exception.

    f.  Let iter be the result of GetIterator(ToObject(iterable)).

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(iter).

8.  If the value of set’s [[SetData]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED,
    then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

9.  Assert: set has not been reentrantly initialized.

10. Set set’s [[SetData]] internal slot to a new empty List.

11. If iter is UNDEFINED, then return set.

12. Repeat

    a.  Let next be the result of IteratorStep(iter).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

    c.  If next is FALSE, then return set.

    d.  Let nextValue be IteratorValue(next).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextValue).

    f.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of adder with set as thisArgument and a List whose
        sole element is nextValue as argumentsList.

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

NOTE Using a method call for inserting values during initialization
enables subclasses to that redefine add to still make a super call to
the inherited constructor.

new Set ( ...argumentsList )

When SET is called as part of a NEW expression it is a constructor: it
initializes a newly created object. Set called as part of a new
expression with argument list argumentsList performs the following
steps:

1.  Let F be the Set function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct(F, argumentsList).

If Set is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Set Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Set constructor is
the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Set constructor has
the following properties:

Set.prototype

The initial value of SET.PROTOTYPE is the intrinsic %SetPrototype%
object (23.2.3).

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

Set[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of a Set function object F performs the following
steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%SETPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[SetData]])).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of the Set Prototype Object

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Set prototype object
is the standard built-in Object prototype object (19.1.3). The Set
prototype object is an ordinary object. It does not have a [[SetData]]
internal slot.

    internal slot.

6.  Repeat for each e that is an element of entries,

    a.  If e is not empty and SameValueZero(e, value) is TRUE,
        then

        i.  Return S.

7.  If value is −0, then let value be +0.

8.  Append value as the last element of entries.

9.  Return S.

Set.prototype.clear ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let S be THIS value.

2.  If Type(S) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If S does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If S’s [[SetData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  Let entries be the List that is the value of S’s [[SetData]]
    internal slot.

6.  Repeat for each e that is an element of entries,

    a.  Replace the element of entries whose value is e with an
        element whose value is empty.

7.  Return UNDEFINED.

Set.prototype.constructor

The initial value of SET.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the built-in SET
constructor.

Set.prototype.delete ( value )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(S) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If S does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If S’s [[SetData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

        then

        i.  Replace the element of entries whose value is e with an
            element whose value is empty.

        ii. Return TRUE.

7.  Return FALSE.

NOTE The value EMPTY is used as a specification device to indicate that
an entry has been deleted. Actual implementations may take other actions
such as physically removing the entry from internal data structures.

Set.prototype.entries ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  Return the result of calling the CreateSetIterator abstract
    operation with arguments S and "KEY+VALUE".

NOTE For iteration purposes, a Set appears similar to a Map where each
entry has the same value for its key and value.

Set.prototype.forEach ( callbackfn [ , thisArg ] )

NOTE callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments.
FOREACH calls callbackfn once for each value present in the set
object, in value insertion order. callbackfn is called only for values
of the Set which actually exist; it is not called for keys that have
been deleted from the set.

If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the THIS value
for each invocation of callbackfn. If it is not provided, UNDEFINED is
used instead.

If callbackfn is an Arrow Function, THIS was lexically bound when the
function was created so thisArg will have no effect.

callbackfn is called with three arguments: the first two arguments are
a value contained in the Set. The same value of passed for both
arguments. The Set object being traversed is passed as the third
argument.

The callbackfn is called with three arguments to be consistent with
the call back functions used by FOREACH methods for Map and Array. For
Sets, each item value is considered to be both the key and the value.

FOREACH does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but
the object may be mutated by the calls to callbackfn.

Each value is normally visited only once. However, a value will be
revisited if it is deleted after it has been visited and then re-added
before the to FOREACH call completes. Values that are deleted after the
call to FOREACH begins and before being visited are not visited unless
the value is added again before the to FOREACH call completes. New
values added, after the call to FOREACH begins are visited.

When the FOREACH method is called with one or two arguments, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(S) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If S does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If S’s [[SetData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If IsCallable(callbackfn) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be
    UNDEFINED.

7.  Let entries be the List that is the value of S’s [[SetData]]
    internal slot.

8.  Repeat for each e that is an element of entries, in original
    insertion order

    a.  If e is not empty, then

        i.  Let funcResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
            internal method of callbackfn with T as thisArgument
            and a List containing e, e, and S as argumentsList.

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(funcResult).

9.  Return UNDEFINED.

The LENGTH property of the FOREACH method is 1.

Set.prototype.has ( value )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(S) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If S does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If S’s [[SetData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

5.  Let entries be the List that is the value of S’s [[SetData]]
    internal slot.

6.  Repeat for each e that is an element of entries,

    a.  If e is not empty and SameValueZero(e, value) is TRUE,
        then return TRUE.

7.  Return FALSE.

Set.prototype.keys ( )

The initial value of the KEYS property is the same function object as
the initial value of the VALUES property.

NOTE For iteration purposes, a Set appears similar to a Map where each
entry has the same value for its key and value.

get Set.prototype.size 

SET.PROTOTYPE.SIZE is an accessor property whose set accessor function
is UNDEFINED. Its get accessor function performs the following steps:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(S) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If S does not have a [[SetData]] internal slot throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

4.  If S’s [[SetData]] internal slot is UNDEFINED, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

"SET".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

prototype. After initialization by the Set constructor, Set instances
also have a [[SetData]] internal slot.

Set Iterator Objects 

A Set Iterator is an ordinary object, with the structure defined below,
that represents a specific iteration over some specific Set instance
object. There is not a named constructor for Set Iterator objects.
Instead, set iterator objects are created by calling certain methods of
Set instance objects.

CreateSetIterator Abstract Operation

WeakMap Objects

WeakMap objects are collections of key/value pairs where the keys are
objects and values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A
WeakMap may be queried to see if it contains an key/value pair with a
specific key, but no mechanisms is provided for enumerating the objects
it holds as keys. If an object that is being used as the key of a
WeakMap key/value pair is only reachable by following a chain of
references that start within that WeakMap, then that key/value pair is
inaccessible and is automatically removed from the WeakMap. WeakMap
implementations must detect and remove such key/value pairs and any
associated resources.

An implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between
the time a key/value pair of a WeakMap becomes inaccessible and the time
when the key/value pair is removed from the WeakMap. If this latency was
observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of indeterminacy
that could impact program execution.  For that reason, an ECMAScript
implementation must not provide any means to observe a key of a WeakMap
that does not require the observer to present the observed key. 

WeakMap objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other
mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on
the number of key/value pairs in the collection. The data structure used
in this WeakMap objects specification are only intended to describe the
required observable semantics of WeakMap objects. It is not intended to
be a viable implementation model.

NOTE WeakMap and WeakSets are intended to provide mechanisms for
dynamically associating state with an object in a manner that does not
“leak” memory resources if, in the absence of the WeakMap or WeakSet,
the object otherwise became inaccessible and subject to resource
reclamation by the implementation’s garbage collection mechanisms.
Achieving this characteristic requires coordination between the WeakMap
or WeakSet implementation and the garbage collector. The following
references describe mechanism that may be useful to implementations of
WeakMap and WeakSets:

The WeakMap Constructor 

The WeakMap constructor is the %WeakMap% intrinsic object and the
initial value of the WEAKMAP property of the global object. When WEAKMAP
is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it initializes its
THIS value with the internal state necessary to support the
WEAKMAP.PROTOTYPE built-in methods.

The WEAKMAP constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used
as the value in an EXTENDS clause of a class definition. Subclass
constructors that intend to inherit the specified WEAKMAP behaviour must
include a SUPER call to WEAKMAP.

WeakMap ( [ iterable ] )

When the WEAKMAP function is called with optional argument iterable
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let map be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(map) is not Object then, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If map does not have a [[WeakMapData]] internal slot, then throw a
    TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If map’s [[WeakMapData]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED, then
    throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If iterable is not present, let iterable be UNDEFINED.

6.  If iterable is either UNDEFINED or NULL, then let iter be
    UNDEFINED.

7.  Else,

    a.  b.  c.  Let adder be the result of Get(map, "SET").

    d.  ReturnIfAbrupt(adder).

    e.  If IsCallable(adder) is FALSE, throw a TYPEERROR Exception.

    f.  Let iter be the result of GetIterator(iterable).

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(iter).

8.  If the value of map’s [[WeakMapData]] internal slot is not
    UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

9.  Assert: map has not been reentrantly initialized.

10. Set map’s [[WeakMapData]] internal slot to a new empty List.

11. If iter is UNDEFINED, then return map.

12. Repeat

    a.  Let next be the result of IteratorStep(iter).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(next).

    c.  If next is FALSE, then return map.

    d.  Let nextValue be IteratorValue(next).

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextValue).

    f.  If Type(nextValue) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR
        exception

    g.  Let k be the result of Get(nextValue, "0").

    h.  ReturnIfAbrupt(k).

    i.  Let v be the result of Get(nextValue, "1").

    j.  ReturnIfAbrupt(v).

    k.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of adder with map as thisArgument and a List whose
        elements are k and v as argumentsList.

    l.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

NOTE If the parameter iterable is present, it is expected to be an
object that implements an @@iterator method that returns an iterator
object that produces a two element array-like object whose first element
is a value that will be used as a WeakMap key and whose second element
is the value to associate with that key.

new WeakMap ( ...argumentsList )

When WEAKMAP is called as part of a NEW expression it is a constructor:
it initializes a newly created object.

WEAKMAP called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the WeakMap function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct(F, argumentsList).

If WeakMap is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the WeakMap Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the WeakMap constructor
is the Function prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the WeakMap constructor

        TRUE, then

        i.  Set p.[[key]] to empty.

        ii. Set p.[[value]] to empty.

        iii. Return TRUE.

8.  Return FALSE.

The following steps are taken:

1.  Let M be the THIS value.

        TRUE, then return TRUE.

8.  Return FALSE.

FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of WeakMap Instances

WeakMap instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
WeakMap prototype. WeakMap instances also have a [[WeakMapData]]
internal slot.


WeakSet Objects

WeakSet objects are collections of objects. A distinct object may only
occur once as an element of a WeakSet’s collection. A WeakSet may be
queried to see if it contains a specific object, but no mechanisms is
provided for enumerating the objects it holds. If an object that is
contain by a WeakSet is only reachable by following a chain of
references that start within that WeakSet, then that object is
inaccessible and is automatically removed from the WeakSet. WeakSet
implementations must detect and remove such objects and any associated
resources.

An implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between
the time an object contained in a WeakSet becomes inaccessible and the
time when the object is removed from the WeakSet. If this latency was
observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of indeterminacy
that could impact program execution.  For that reason, an ECMAScript
implementation must not provide any means to determine if a WeakSet
contains a particular object that does not require the observer to
present the observed object.

WeakSet objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other
mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on
the number of elements in the collection. The data structure used in
this WeakSet objects specification is only intended to describe the
required observable semantics of WeakSet objects. It is not intended to
be a viable implementation model.

NOTE See the NOTE in 23.3.

The WeakSet Constructor 

The WeakSet constructor is the %WeakSet% intrinsic object and the
initial value of the WEAKSET property of the global object. When WEAKSET
is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it initializes its
THIS value with the internal state necessary to support the

The WEAKSET constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used
as the value in an EXTENDS clause of a class definition. Subclass

    e.  ReturnIfAbrupt(nextValue).

    f.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of adder with set as thisArgument and a List whose
        sole element is nextValue as argumentsList.

    g.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

STRUCTURED DATA


ArrayBuffer Objects

Abstract Operations For ArrayBuffer Objects

AllocateArrayBuffer( constructor )

The abstract operation AllocateArrayBuffer with argument constructor
is used to create an uninitialized ArrayBuffer object. It performs the
following steps:

1.  Let obj be OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(constructor,
    "%ARRAYBUFFERPROTOTYPE%", ( [[ArrayBufferData]],
    [[ArrayBufferByteLength]]) ).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(obj).

3.  Set the [[ArrayBufferByteLength]] internal slot of obj to 0.

4.  Return obj.

IsNeuteredBuffer( arrayBuffer )

The abstract operation IsNeuteredBuffer with argument arrayBuffer
performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(arrayBuffer) is Object and it has [[ArrayBufferData]]
    internal slot.

2.  If arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot is NULL, then
    return TRUE.

3.  Return FALSE.

NeuterArrayBuffer( arrayBuffer )

The abstract operation NeuterArrayBuffer with argument arrayBuffer
performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(arrayBuffer) is Object and it has [[ArrayBufferData]]
    and [[ArrayBufferByteLength]] internal slots.

2.  Set arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot to NULL.

3.  Set arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferByteLength]] internal slot to 0.

4.  Return NormalCompletion(NULL).

NOTE Neutering an ArrayBuffer instance disassociates the Data Block used
as its backing store from the instance and sets the byte length of the
buffer to 0. No operations defined by this specification uses the
NeuterArrayBuffer abstract operation. However, an ECMAScript
implementation or host environment may define such operations.

SetArrayBufferData( arrayBuffer, bytes )

The abstract operation SetArrayBufferData with arguments arrayBuffer
and bytes is used to initialize the storage block encapsulated by an
ArrayBuffer object. It performs the following steps:

1.  ReturnIfAbrupt(arrayBuffer).

2.  Assert: Type(arrayBuffer) is Object and it has an
    [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot.

3.  Assert: bytes is a positive integer.

4.  Let block be CreateByteDataBlock(bytes).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(block).

6.  Set arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot to block.

7.  Set arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferByteLength]] internal slot to
    bytes.

8.  Return arrayBuffer.

CloneArrayBuffer( srcBuffer, srcByteOffset )

The abstract operation CloneArrayBuffer takes two parameters, an
ArrayBuffer srcBuffer and an integer srcByteOffset. It creates a new
ArrayBuffer whose data is a copy of srcBuffer’s data starting at
srcByteOffset. This operation performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: Type(srcBuffer) is Object and it has an
    [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot.

2.  Let srcBlock be the value of srcBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]]
    internal slot.

3.  If srcBlock is UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If IsNeuteredBuffer(srcBuffer) is TRUE, then throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

5.  Let srcLength be the value of srcBuffer’s
    [[ArrayBufferByteLength]] internal slot.

6.  Let bufferConstructor be Get(srcBuffer, "CONSTRUCTOR").

7.  ReturnIfAbrupt(bufferConstructor).

8.  Assert: srcByteOffset ≤ srcLength.

9.  Let cloneLength be srcLength – srcByteOffset.

10. If bufferConstructor is UNDEFINED, then let bufferConstructor be
    %ArrayBuffer%.

11. Let targetBuffer be AllocateArrayBuffer(bufferConstructor).

12. NOTE: Side-effects of the above steps may have neutered srcBuffer.

13. If IsNeuteredBuffer(srcBuffer) is TRUE, then throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

14. Let srcBlock be the value of srcBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]]
    internal slot.

15. Let status be SetArrayBufferData(targetBuffer, cloneLength).

16. ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

    srcByteOffset, cloneLength).

19. Return targetBuffer.

GetValueFromBuffer ( arrayBuffer, byteIndex, type, isLittleEndian )

The abstract operation GetValueFromBuffer takes four parameters, an
ArrayBuffer arrayBuffer, an integer byteIndex, a String type, and
optionally a Boolean isLittleEndian. This operation performs the
following steps:

1.  Assert: arrayBuffer has been initialized.

2.  Assert: IsNeuteredBuffer(arrayBuffer) is FALSE.

3.  Assert: There are sufficient bytes in arrayBuffer starting at
    byteIndex to represent a value of type.

4.  Assert: byteIndex is a positive integer.

5.  Let block be arrayBuffer’s [[ArrayBufferData]] internal slot.

6.  7.  Let elementSize be the Number value of the Element Size value
    specified in Table 45 for Element Type type.

8.  Let rawValue be a List of _elementSize containing, in order,_ the
    elementSize bytes starting at byteIndex of block.

9.  If isLittleEndian is not present, set isLittleEndian to either
    TRUE or FALSE. The choice is implementation dependent and should be
    the alternative that is most efficient for the implementation. An
    implementation must use the same value each time this step is
    executed and the same value must be used for the corresponding step
    in the SetValueInBuffer abstract operation.

10. If isLittleEndian is FALSE, reverse the order of the elements of
    rawValue.

11. If type is “Float32” , then

    a.  Let value be the byte elements of rawValue concatenated and
        interpreted as a little-endian bit string encoding of an IEEE
        754-2008 binary32 value.

    b.  If value is an IEEE 754-2008 binary32 NaN value, return the
        NAN Number value.

    c.  Return the Number value that corresponds to value.

12. If type is “Float64” , then

    a.  Let value be the byte elements of rawValue concatenated and
        interpreted as a little-endian bit string encoding of an IEEE
        754-2008 binary64 value.

    b.  If value is an IEEE 754-2008 binary64 NaN value, return the
        NAN Number value.

    c.  Return the Number value that corresponds to value.

13. If the first code unit of type is "U", then

    a.  Let intValue be the byte elements of rawValue concatenated
        and interpreted as a bit string encoding of an unsigned
        little-endian binary number.

SetValueInBuffer ( arrayBuffer, byteIndex, type, value, isLittleEndian )

The abstract operation SetValueInBuffer takes five parameters, an
ArrayBuffer arrayBuffer, an integer byteIndex, a String type, a
Number value, and optionally a Boolean isLittleEndian. This
operation performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: arrayBuffer has been initialized.

2.  Assert: IsNeuteredBuffer(arrayBuffer) is FALSE.

3.  Assert: There are sufficient bytes in arrayBuffer starting at
    byteIndex to represent a value of type.

9.  If isLittleEndian is not present, set isLittleEndian to either
    TRUE or FALSE. The choice is implementation dependent and should be
    the alternative that is most efficient for the implementation. An
    implementation must use the same value each time this step is
    executed and the same value must be used for the corresponding step
    in the GetValueFromBuffer abstract operation.

        isLittleEndian is FALSE, the bytes are arranged in big endian
        order. Otherwise, the bytes are arranged in little endian order.

    a.  Set rawValue to a List containing the 8 bytes that are the
        IEEE-868-2008 binary64 format encoding of value. If
        isLittleEndian is FALSE, the bytes are arranged in big endian
        order. Otherwise, the bytes are arranged in little endian order.
        If value is NAN, rawValue may be set to any implementation
        choosen non-signaling NaN encoding.

    a.  Let n be the the Number value of the Element Size specified in
        Table 45 for Element Type type.

    d.  If intValue ≥ 0, then

        i.  Let rawBytes be a List containing the n-byte binary
            encoding of intValue. If isLittleEndian is FALSE, the
            bytes are ordered in big endian order. Otherwise, the bytes
            are ordered in little endian order.

    e.  Else,

        i.  Let rawBytes be a List containing the n-byte binary 2’s
            complement encoding of intValue. If isLittleEndian is
            FALSE, the bytes are ordered in big endian order. Otherwise,
            the bytes are ordered in little endian order.

13. Store the individual bytes of rawBytes in order starting at
    position byteIndex of block.

14. Return NormalCompletion (UNDEFINED).

The JSON object does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not
possible to invoke the JSON object as a function.

JSON.parse ( text [ , reviver ] )

The PARSE function parses a JSON text (a JSON-formatted String) and
produces an ECMAScript value. The JSON format is a subset of the syntax
for ECMAScript literals, Array Initializers and Object Initializers.
After parsing, JSON objects are realized as ECMAScript objects. JSON
arrays are realized as ECMAScript Array instances. JSON strings,
numbers, booleans, and null are realized as ECMAScript Strings, Numbers,
Booleans, and NULL.

The optional reviver parameter is a function that takes two
parameters, (key and value). It can filter and transform the
results. It is called with each of the key_/_value pairs produced by
the parse, and its return value is used instead of the original value.
If it returns what it received, the structure is not modified. If it
returns UNDEFINED then the property is deleted from the result.

1.  Let JText be ToString(text).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(JText).

3.  Parse JText interpreted as UTF-16 encoded Unicode points as a JSON
    text as specified in
    ECMA-404. Throw a SYNTAXERROR exception if JText is not a valid
    JSON text as defined in that specification.

4.  Let scriptText be the result of concatenating "(", JText, and
    ");".

5.  Let completion be the result of parsing and evaluating
    scriptText as if it was the source text of an ECMAScript Script.
    but using the alternative definition of DoubleStringCharacter
    provided below. The extended PropertyDefinitionEvaluation semantics
    defined in B.3.1 must not be used during the evaluation.

6.  Let unfiltered be completion.[[value]].

7.  Assert: unfiltered will be either a primitive value or an object
    that is defined by either an ArrayLiteral or an ObjectLiteral.

8.  If IsCallable(reviver) is TRUE, then

    a.  Let root be ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%).

    b.  Let status be the result of CreateDataProperty(root, the
        empty String, unfiltered).

    c.  Assert: status is TRUE.

    d.  Return the result of calling the abstract operation Walk,
        passing root and the empty String. The abstract operation Walk
        is described below.

9.  Else

    a.  Return unfiltered.

JSON allows Unicode code points U+2028 and U+2029 to directly appear in
String literals without using an escape sequence. This is enabled by
using the following alternative definition of DoubleStringCharacter
when parsing scriptText in step 5:

DoubleStringCharacter ::

SourceCharacter BUT NOT ONE OF " OR \ OR U+0000 THROUGH U+001F

\ EscapeSequence

-   The CV of DoubleStringCharacter :: SourceCharacter BUT NOT ONE
    OF " OR \ OR U+0000 THROUGH U+001F is the UTF-16Encoding (10.1.1) of
    the code point value of SourceCharacter.

NOTE The syntax of a valid JSON text is a subset of the ECMAScript
PrimaryExpression syntax. Hence a valid JSON text is also a valid
PrimaryExpression. Step 3 above verifies that JText conforms to that
subset. When scriptText is parsed and evaluated as a Script the
result will be either a String, Number, Boolean, or Null primitive value
or an Object defined as if by an ArrayLiteral or ObjectLiteral.

Runtime Semantics: Walk Abstract Operation

The abstract operation Walk is a recursive abstract operation that takes
two parameters: a holder object and the String name of a property in
that object. Walk uses the value of reviver that was originally passed
to the above parse function.

1.  Let val be the result of Get(holder, name).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(val).

3.  If val is an object, then

    a.  If val is an exotic Array object then

        i.  Set I to 0.

        ii. Let len be the result of Get(val, "LENGTH").

        iii. Assert: len is not an abrupt completion and its value is
            a positive integer.

        iv. Repeat while I < len,

            1.  Let newElement be the result of calling the abstract
                operation Walk, passing val and ToString(I).

            2.  If newElement is UNDEFINED, then

                a.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Delete]]
                    internal method of val with ToString(I) as the
                    argument.

            3.  Else

                a.  Let status be the result of calling the
                    [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of val with
                    arguments ToString(I) and
                    PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: newElement,
                    [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE,
                    [[Configurable]]: TRUE}.

                b.  NOTE This algorithm intentionally does not throw an
                    exception if status is FALSE.

            4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

            5.  Add 1 to I.

    b.  Else

        i.  Let keys be EnumerableOwnNames(val).

        ii. For each String P in keys do,

            1.  Let newElement be the result of calling the abstract
                operation Walk, passing val and P.

            2.  If newElement is UNDEFINED, then

                a.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Delete]]
                    internal method of val with P as the argument.

            3.  Else

                a.  Let status be the result of calling the
                    [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of val with
                    arguments P and PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]:
                    newElement, [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]:
                    TRUE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE}.

                b.  NOTE This algorithm intentionally does not throw an
                    exception if status is FALSE.

            4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

4.  Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
    reviver passing holder as thisArgument and with a List
    containing name and val as argumentsList.

It is not permitted for a conforming implementation of JSON.PARSE to
extend the JSON grammars. If an implementation wishes to support a
modified or extended JSON interchange format it must do so by defining a
different parse function.

NOTE In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an
object, lexically preceding values for the same key shall be
overwritten.

JSON.stringify ( value [ , replacer [ , space ] ] )

The STRINGIFY function returns a String in UTF-16 encoded JSON format
representing an ECMAScript value. It can take three parameters. The
value parameter is an ECMAScript value, which is usually an object or
array, although it can also be a String, Boolean, Number or NULL. The
optional replacer parameter is either a function that alters the way
objects and arrays are stringified, or an array of Strings and Numbers
that acts as a white list for selecting the object properties that will
be stringified. The optional space parameter is a String or Number
that allows the result to have white space injected into it to improve
human readability.

These are the steps in stringifying an object:

1.  Let stack be an empty List.

2.  Let indent be the empty String.

3.  Let PropertyList and ReplacerFunction be UNDEFINED.

4.  If Type(replacer) is Object, then

    a.  If IsCallable(replacer) is TRUE, then

        i.  Let ReplacerFunction be replacer.

    b.  Else if replacer is an exotic Array object, then

        i.  Let PropertyList be an empty List

        ii. For each value v of a property of replacer that has an
            array index property name. The properties are enumerated in
            the ascending array index order of their names.

            1.  Let item be UNDEFINED.

            2.  If Type(v) is String then let item be v.

            3.  Else if Type(v) is Number then let item be
                ToString(v).

            4.  Else if Type(v) is Object then,

                a.  If v has a [[StringData]] or [[NumberData]]
                    internal slot, then let item be ToString(v).

            5.  If item is not UNDEFINED and item is not currently
                an element of PropertyList then,

                a.  Append item to the end of PropertyList.

5.  If Type(space) is Object then,

    a.  If space has a [[NumberData]] internal slot then,

        i.  Let space be ToNumber(space).

    b.  Else if space has a [[StringData]] internal slot then,

        i.  Let space be ToString(space).

6.  If Type(space) is Number

    a.  Let space be min(10, ToInteger(space)).

    b.  Set gap to a String containing space occurrences of code
        unit 0x0020 (SPACE). This will be the empty String if space is
        less than 1.

7.  Else if Type(space) is String

    a.  If the number of elements in space is 10 or less, set gap to
        space otherwise set gap to a String consisting of the first
        10 elements of space.

8.  Else

    a.  Set gap to the empty String.

9.  Let wrapper be ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%).

10. Let status be the result of CreateDataProperty(wrapper, the
    empty String, value).

11. Assert: status is TRUE.

12. Return the result of calling the abstract operation Str(the empty
    String, wrapper).

NOTE 1 JSON structures are allowed to be nested to any depth, but they
must be acyclic. If value is or contains a cyclic structure, then the
stringify function must throw a TYPEERROR exception. This is an example
of a value that cannot be stringified:

  a = [];

  a[0] = a;

  my_text = JSON.stringify(a); // This must throw a TypeError.

NOTE 2 Symbolic primitive values are rendered as follows:

-   The NULL value is rendered in JSON text as the String NULL.

-   The UNDEFINED value is not rendered.

-   The TRUE value is rendered in JSON text as the String TRUE.

-   The FALSE value is rendered in JSON text as the String FALSE.

NOTE 3 String values are wrapped in double quotes. The code units " and
\ are escaped with \ prefixes. Control characters code units are
replaced with escape sequences \UHHHH, or with the shorter forms, \B
(backspace), \F (form feed), \N (LINE FEED), \R (carriage return), \T
(CHARACTER TABULATION).

NOTE 4 Finite numbers are stringified as if by calling
ToString(number). NAN and Infinity regardless of sign are represented
as the String NULL.

NOTE 5 Values that do not have a JSON representation (such as UNDEFINED
and functions) do not produce a String. Instead they produce the
UNDEFINED value. In arrays these values are represented as the String
NULL. In objects an unrepresentable value causes the property to be
excluded from stringification.

NOTE 6 An object is rendered as an opening left brace followed by zero
or more properties, separated with commas, closed with a right brace. A
property is a quoted String representing the key or property name, a
colon, and then the stringified property value. An array is rendered as
an opening left bracket followed by zero or more values, separated with
commas, closed with a right bracket.

Runtime Semantics: Str Abstract Operation

The abstract operation Str(key, holder) has access to
ReplacerFunction from the invocation of the STRINGIFY method. Its
algorithm is as follows:

1.  Let value be the result of Get(holder, key).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(value).

3.  If Type(value) is Object, then

    a.  Let toJSON be the result of Get(value, "TOJSON").

    b.  If IsCallable(toJSON) is TRUE

        i.  Let value be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
            method of toJSON passing value as thisArgument and a
            List containing key as argumentsList.

        ii. ReturnIfAbrupt(value).

4.  If ReplacerFunction is not UNDEFINED, then

    a.  Let value be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of ReplacerFunction passing holder as the THIS value
        and with an argument list consisting of key and value.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(value).

5.  If Type(value) is Object then,

    a.  If value has a [[NumberData]] internal slot then,

        i.  Let value be ToNumber(value).

    b.  Else if value has a [[StringData]] internal slot then,

        i.  Let value be ToString(value).

    c.  Else if value has a [[BooleanData]] internal slot then,

        i.  Let value be the value of the [[BooleanData]] internal
            slot of value.

        ii. If value is UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  If value is NULL then return "NULL".

7.  If value is TRUE then return "TRUE".

8.  If value is FALSE then return "FALSE".

9.  If Type(value) is String, then return the result of calling the
    abstract operation Quote with argument value.

10. If Type(value) is Number

    a.  If value is finite then return ToString(value).

    b.  Else, return "NULL".

11. If Type(value) is Object, and IsCallable(value) is FALSE

    a.  If value is an exotic Array object then

        i.  Return the result of calling the abstract operation JA with
            argument value.

    b.  Else, return the result of calling the abstract operation JO
        with argument value.

12. Return UNDEFINED.

Runtime Semantics: Quote Abstract Operation

The abstract operation Quote(value) wraps a String value in double
quotes and escapes code units within it.

1.  Let product be code unit U+0022 (QUOTATION MARK).

2.  For each code unit C in value

    a.  If C is U+0022 or U+005C (reverse solidus)

        letters.

1.  Let product be the concatenation of product and code unit U+0022
    (QUOTATION MARK).

Runtime Semantics: JO Abstract Operation

The abstract operation JO(value) serializes an object. It has access
to the stack, indent, gap, and PropertyList of the invocation of
the STRINGIFY method.

1.  If stack contains value then throw a TYPEERROR exception because
    the structure is cyclical.

2.  Append value to stack.

3.  Let stepback be indent.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(strP).

    c.  If strP is not UNDEFINED

        i.  Let member be the result of calling the abstract operation
            Quote with argument P.

        ii. Let member be the concatenation of member and the string
            ":".

        iii. If gap is not the empty String

                unit U+020 (SPACE).

        iv. Let member be the concatenation of member and strP.

        v.  Append member to partial.

9.  If partial is empty, then

    a.  Let final be "{}".

10. Else

    a.  If gap is the empty String

        i.  Let properties be a String formed by concatenating all the
            element Strings of partial with each adjacent pair of
            Strings separated with code unit U+002C (comma). A comma is
            not inserted either before the first String or after the
            last String.

13. Return final.

Runtime Semantics: JA Abstract Operation

The abstract operation JA(value) serializes an array. It has access to
the stack, indent, and gap of the invocation of the stringify
method. The representation of arrays includes only the elements between

JSON [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"JSON".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.



CONTROL ABSTRACTION OBJECTS 


Common Iteration Interfaces

An interface is a set of property keys whose associated values match a
specific specification. Any object that provides all the properties as
described by an interface’s specification conforms to that interface.
An interface is not represented by an distinct object. There may be many
separately implemented objects that conform to any interface. An
individual object may conform to multiple interfaces.

The Iterable Interface

The Iterable interface includes the following property:

  PROPERTY     VALUE                                               REQUIREMENTS
  ------------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  @@ITERATOR   A zero arguments function that returns an object.   The function returns an object that conforms to the iterator interface.

The Iterator Interface

The Iterator interface includes the following properties:

  PROPERTY   VALUE                                REQUIREMENTS
  ---------- ------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NEXT       A function that returns an object.   The function returns an object that conforms to the IteratorResult interface. If a previous call to the NEXT method of an Iterator has returned an IteratorResult object whose DONE property is TRUE, then all subsequent calls to the NEXT method of that object must also return an IteratorResult object whose DONE property is TRUE,

NOTE Arguments may be passed to the next function but their
interpretation and validity is dependent upon the target Iterator. The
for-of statement and other common users of Iterators do not pass any
arguments, so Iterators that expect to be used in such a manner must be
prepared to deal with being called with no arguments.

The IteratorResult Interface

The IteratorResult interface includes the following properties:

  PROPERTY   VALUE                           REQUIREMENTS
  ---------- ------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DONE       Either TRUE or FALSE.           This is the result status of an iterator NEXT method call. If the end of the iterator was reached DONE is TRUE. If the end was not reached DONE is FALSE and a value is available. If a DONE property (either own or inherited does not exist), it is consider to have the value FALSE.
  VALUE      Any ECMAScript languge value.   If done is FALSE, this is the current iteration element value. If done is TRUE, this is the return value of the iterator, if it supplied one. If the iterator does not have a return value, VALUE is UNDEFINED. In that case, the VALUE property may be absent from the conforming object if it does not inherit an explicit VALUE property.


GeneratorFunction Objects

GENERATOR FUNCTION objects are constructor functions that are usually
created by evaluating GeneratorDeclaration, GeneratorExpression, and
GeneratorMethod syntactic productions. They may also be created by
calling the GENERATORFUNCTION constructor.

  --
  --

Figure 2 (Informative) — Generator Objects Relationships

The GeneratorFunction Constructor

The GeneratorFunction constructor is the %GeneratorFunction% intrinsic.
When GENERATORFUNCTION is called as a function rather than as a
constructor, it creates and initializes a new GeneratorFunction object.
Thus the function call GENERATORFUNCTION (…) is equivalent to the object
creation expression NEW GENERATORFUNCTION (…) with the same arguments.
However, if the THIS value passed in the call is an Object with a
[[Code]] internal slot whose value is UNDEFINED, it initializes the THIS
value using the argument values. This permits GENERATORFUNCTION to be
used both as factory method and to perform constructor instance
initialization.

GENERATORFUNCTION may be subclassed and subclass constructors may
perform a SUPER invocation of the GENERATORFUNCTION constructor to
initialize subclass instances. However, all syntactic forms for defining
generator function objects create direct instances of GENERATORFUNCTION.
There is no syntactic means to create instances of GENERATORFUNCTION
subclasses.

GeneratorFunction (p1, p2, … , pn, body)

The last argument specifies the body (executable code) of a generator
function; any preceding arguments specify formal parameters.

When the GENERATORFUNCTION function is called with some arguments p1,
p2, … , pn, body (where n might be 0, that is, there are no
“p” arguments, and where body might also not be provided), the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let argCount be the total number of arguments passed to this
    function invocation.

2.  Let P be the empty String.

3.  If argCount = 0, let bodyText be the empty String.

4.  Else if argCount = 1, let bodyText be that argument.

5.  Else argCount > 1,

    a.  Let firstArg be the first argument.

    b.  Let P be ToString(firstArg).

    c.  ReturnIfAbrupt(P).

    d.  Let k be 2.

    e.  Repeat, while k < argCount

A PROTOTYPE property is automatically created for every function created
using the GENERATORFUNCTION constructor, to provide for the possibility
that the function will be used as a constructor.

new GeneratorFunction ( ... argumentsList)

When GENERATORFUNCTION is called as part of a NEW expression, it creates
and initializes a newly created object:

1.  Let F be the GENERATORFUNCTION function object on which the NEW
    operator was applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return the result of Construct (F, argumentsList).

If GENERATORFUNCTION is implemented as an ECMAScript function object,
its [[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the GeneratorFunction Constructor

The GeneratorFunction constructor is a built-in Function object that
inherits from the Function constructor. The value of the [[Prototype]]
internal slot of the GeneratorFunction constructor is the intrinsic
object %Function%.

The value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot of the GeneratorFunction
constructor is TRUE.

The value of the NAME property of the GeneratorFunction is
"GENERATORFUNCTION".

The GeneratorFunction constructor has the following properties:

 GeneratorFunction.length

This is a data property with a value of 1. This property has the
attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]: FALSE,
[[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

GeneratorFunction.prototype

The initial value of GENERATORFUNCTION.PROTOTYPE is %Generator%, the
standard built-in GeneratorFunction prototype.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: FALSE }.

 GeneratorFunction[ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let proto be the result of GetPrototypeFromConstructor(F,
    "%GENERATOR%").

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(proto).

4.  Return FunctionAllocate(proto, FALSE, "GENERATOR").

5.  

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE The GeneratorFunction @@CREATE function passes FALSE as the
strict parameter to FunctionAllocate. This causes the allocated
ECMAScript function object to have the internal methods of a non-strict
constructor function. The GENERATORFUNCTION constructor may reset the
functions [[Strict]] internal slot to TRUE. It is up to the
implementation whether this also changes the internal methods.

Properties of the GeneratorFunction Prototype Object

The GeneratorFunction prototype object is an ordinary object. It is not
a function object and does not have a [[Code]] internal slot or any
other of the internal slots listed in Table 26 or Table 48. In addition
to being the value of the prototype property of the %GeneratorFunction%
intrinsic and is itself the %Generator% intrinsic.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the GeneratorFunction
prototype object is the %FunctionPrototype% intrinsic object. The
initial value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot of the
GeneratorFunction prototype object is TRUE.

GeneratorFunction.prototype.constructor

The initial value of GENERATORFUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the
intrinsic object %GeneratorFunction%.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

GeneratorFunction.prototype.prototype

The value of GENERATORFUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.PROTOTYPE is the
%GeneratorPrototype% intrinsic object.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

 GeneratorFunction.prototype [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"GENERATORFUNCTION".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

 GeneratorFunction.prototype [ @@create ] ( )

The @@create method of an object F performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the THIS value.

2.  Let obj be the result of calling
    OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(F, "%GENERATORPROTOTYPE%", (
    [[GeneratorState]], [[GeneratorContext]]) ).

3.  Return obj.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.CREATE]".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

GeneratorFunction Instances

Every GeneratorFunction instance is an ECMAScript function object and
has the internal slots listed in Table 26. The value of the
[[FunctionKind]] internal slot for all such instances is "GENERATOR".

The GeneratorFunction instances have the following own properties:

length

The value of the LENGTH property is an integer that indicates the
typical number of arguments expected by the GeneratorFunction. However,
the language permits the function to be invoked with some other number
of arguments. The behaviour of a GeneratorFunction when invoked on a
number of arguments other than the number specified by its LENGTH
property depends on the function.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

prototype

Whenever a GeneratorFunction instance is created another ordinary object
is also created and is the initial value of the generator function’s
PROTOTYPE property. The value of the prototype property is used to
initialize the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a newly created Generator
object before the generator function object is invoked as a constructor
for that newly created object.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

NOTE Unlike function instances, the object that is the value of the a
GeneratorFunction’s PROTOTYPE property does not have a CONSTRUCTOR
property whose value is the GeneratorFunction instance.


Generator Objects

A Generator object is an instance of a generator function and conforms
to both the Iterator and Iterable interfaces.

Generator instances directly inherit properties from the object that is
the value of the PROTOTYPE property of the Generator function that
created the instance. Generator instances indirectly inherit properties
from the Generator Prototype intrinsic, %GeneratorPrototype%.

Properties of Generator Prototype

The Generator prototype object is the %GeneratorPrototype% intrinsic. It
is also the initial value of the PROTOTYPE property of the %Generator%
intrinsic (the GeneratorFrunction.prototype).

The Generator prototype is an ordinary object. It is not a Generator
instance and does not have a [[GeneratorState]] internal slot.

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Generator prototype
object is the intrinsic object %ObjectPrototype% (19.1.3). The initial
value of the [[Extensible]] internal slot of the Function prototype
object is TRUE.

All Generator instances indirectly inherit properties of the Generator
prototype object.

Generator.prototype.constructor

The initial value of GENERATOR.PROTOTYPE.CONSTRUCTOR is the intrinsic
object %Generator%.

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

 Generator.prototype.next ( value )

The NEXT method performs the following steps:

1.  Let g be the THIS value.

2.  Return the result of GeneratorResume(g, value).

Generator.prototype.return ( value )

The THROW method performs the following steps:

1.  Let g be the THIS value.

2.  Let C be Completion{[[type]]: return, [[value]]: value,
    [[target]]: empty}.

3.  Return GeneratorResumeAbrupt(g, C).

Generator.prototype.throw ( exception )

The THROW method performs the following steps:

1.  Let g be the THIS value.

2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  Let C be Completion{[[type]]: throw, [[value]]:
    exception, [[target]]: empty}.

7.  8.  9.  a.  b.  c.  

10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. Return GeneratorResumeAbrupt(g, C).

Generator.prototype [ @@iterator ] ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Return the THIS value.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.ITERATOR]".

Generator.prototype [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"GENERATOR".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Properties of Generator Instances

Generator instances are initially created with the internal slots
described in Table 48.

Table 48 — Internal Slots of Generator Instances

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INTERNAL SLOT          DESCRIPTION

Promise Objects

A Promise is an object that is used as a placeholder for the eventual
results of a deferred (and possibly asynchronous) computation.

Any Promise object is in one of three mutually exclusive states:
fulfilled, rejected, and pending:

-   A promise P is fulfilled if P.THEN(F, R) will immediately enqueue a
    Job to call the function F.

-   A promise P is rejected if P.THEN(F, R) will immediately enqueue a
    Job to call the function R.

-   A promise is pending if it is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

A promise is said to be settled if it is not pending, i.e. if it is
either fulfilled or rejected.

A promise is resolved if it is settled or if it has been "locked in"
to match the state of another promise. Attempting to resolve or reject a
resolved promise has no effect. A promise is unresolved if it is not
resolved. An unresolved promise is always in the pending state. A
resolved promise may be pending, fulfilled or rejected.

Promise Abstract Operations

PromiseCapability Records

A PromiseCapability is a Record value used to encapsulate a promise
object along with the functions that are capable of resolving or
rejecting that promise object. PromiseCapability records are produced by
the NewPromiseCapability abstract operation.

PromiseCapability Records have the fields listed in Table 49.

Table 49 — PromiseCapability Record Fields

  -------------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_   VALUE             MEANING
  [[Promise]]    An object           An object that is usable as a promise.
  [[Resolve]]    A function object   The function that is used to resolve the given promise object.
  [[Reject]]     A function object   The function that is used to reject the given promise object.
  -------------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------

IfAbruptRejectPromise ( value, capability )

IfAbruptRejectPromise is a short hand for a sequence of algorithm steps
that use a PromiseCapability record. An algorithm step of the form:

1.  IfAbruptRejectPromise(value, capability).

means the same thing as:

1.  If value is an abrupt completion,

    a.  Let rejectResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
        internal method of capability.[[Reject]] with UNDEFINED as
        thisArgument and (value.[[value]]) as argumentsList.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(rejectResult).

    c.  Return capability.[[Promise]].

2.  Else if value is a Completion Record, then let value be
    value.[[value]].

PromiseReaction Records

The PromiseReaction is a Record value used to store information about
how a promise should react when it becomes resolved or rejected with a
given value. PromiseReaction records are created by the THEN method of
the Promise prototype, and are used by a PromiseReactionJob.

PromiseReaction records have the fields listed in Table 50.

Table 50 — PromiseReaction Record Fields

  ------------------ ------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _FIELD NAME_       VALUE                         MEANING
  [[Capabilities]]   A PromiseCapability record      The capabilities of the promise for which this record provides a reaction handler.
  [[Handler]]        A function object or a String   The function that should be applied to the incoming value, and whose return value will govern what happens to the derived promise. If [[Handler]] is "IDENTITY" it is equivalent to a function that simply returns its first argument. If [[Handler]] is "THROWER" it is equivalent to a function that throws its first argument as an exception.

NewPromiseCapability ( C )

The abstract operation NewPromiseCapability takes a constructor
function, and attempts to use that constructor function in the fashion
of the built-in PROMISE constructor to create a Promise object and
extract its resolve and reject functions. The promise plus the resolve

functions to trigger in the next Job, and calls them, passing each the
given argument. Typically, these reactions will modify a
previously-returned promise, possibly calling in to a user-supplied
handler before doing so.

1.  Repeat for each reaction in reactions, in original insertion
    order

    a.  Perform EnqueueJob("PROMISEJOBS", PromiseReactionJob,
        (reaction, argument)).

2.  Return UNDEFINED.

Promise Jobs

PromiseReactionJob ( reaction, argument )

The job PromiseReactionJob with parameters reaction and argument
applies the appropriate handler to the incoming value, and uses the
handler's return value to resolve or reject the derived promise
associated with that handler.

1.  Assert: reaction is a PromiseReaction Record.

2.  Let promiseCapability be reaction.[[Capabilities]].

3.  Let handler be reaction.[[Handler]].

4.  If handler is "IDENTITY", then let handlerResult be
    NormalCompletion(argument).

5.  Else If handler is "THROWER", then let handlerResult be
    Completion{[[type]]: throw, [[value]]: argument, [[target]]:
    empty}.

6.  Else, let handlerResult be the result of calling the [[Call]]
    internal method of handler passing UNDEFINED as thisArgument and
    (argument) as argumentsList.

7.  If handlerResult is an abrupt completion, then

    a.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of promiseCapability.[[Reject]] passing UNDEFINED as
        thisArgument and (handlerResult.[[value]]) as
        argumentsList.

    b.  NextJob status.

8.  Let handlerResult be handlerResult.[[value]].

9.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method
    of promiseCapability.[[Resolve]] passing UNDEFINED as
    thisArgument and (handlerResult) as argumentsList.

10. NextJob status.

PromiseResolveThenableJob ( promiseToResolve, thenable, then)

The job PromiseResolveThenableJob with parameters promiseToResolve,
thenable, and then performs the following steps:

1.  Let resolvingFunctions be CreateResolvingFunctions(promise).

2.  Let thenCallResult be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
    method of then passing thenable as the thisArgument and
    (resolvingFunctions.[[Resolve]], resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]])
    as argumentsList.

3.  If thenCallResult is an abrupt completion,

    a.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]] passing UNDEFINED as
        the thisArgument and (thenCallResult.[[value]]) as
        argumentsList.

    b.  NextJob status.

4.  NextJob thenCallResult.

NOTE This Job uses the supplied thenable and its THEN method to resolve
the given promise. This process must take place as a Job to ensure that
the evaluation of the THEN method occurs after evaluation of any
surrounding code has completed.

The Promise Constructor

The Promise constructor is the %Promise% intrinsic object and the
initial value of the PROMISE property of the global object. When PROMISE
is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it initializes its
THIS value with the internal state necessary to support the
PROMISE.PROTOTYPE methods.

The PROMISE constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used
as the value in an EXTENDS clause of a class definition. Subclass
constructors that intend to inherit the specified PROMISE behaviour must
include a SUPER call to PROMISE.

Promise ( executor )

When the PROMISE function is called with argument executor the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let promise be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(promise) is not Object, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If promise does not have a [[PromiseState]] internal slot, then
    throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  If promise's [[PromiseState]] internal slot is not UNDEFINED, then
    throw a TYPEERROR exception.

5.  If IsCallable(executor) is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR
    exception.

6.  Return InitializePromise(promise, executor).

NOTE The executor argument must be a function object. It is called for
initiating and reporting completion of the possibly deferred action
represented by this Promise object. The executor is called with two
arguments: resolve and reject. These are functions that may be used
by the executor function to report eventual completion or failure of
the deferred computation. Returning from the executor function does not
mean that the deferred action has been completed but only that the
request to eventually perform the deferred action has been accepted.

The resolve function that is passed to an executor function accepts
a single argument. The executor code may eventually call the resolve
function to indicate that it wishes to resolve the associated Promise
object. The argument passed to the resolve function represents the
eventual value of the deferred action and can be either the actual
fulfillment value or another Promise object which will provide the value
if it is fulfilled.

The reject function that is passed to an executor function accepts a
single argument. The executor code may eventually call the reject
function to indicate that the associated Promise is rejected and will
never be fulfilled. The argument passed to the reject function is used
as the rejection value of the promise. Typically it will be an ERROR
object.

The resolve and reject functions passed to an executor function by the
Promise constructor have the capability to actually resolve and reject
the associated promise. Subclasses may have different constructor
behaviour that passes in customized values for resolve and reject.

InitializePromise ( promise, executor )

The abstract operation InitializePromise initializes a newly allocated
promise object using an executor function.

1.  Assert: promise has a [[PromiseState]] internal slot and its value
    is UNDEFINED.

2.  Assert: IsCallable(executor) is TRUE.

3.  Set promise's [[PromiseState]] internal slot to "PENDING".

4.  Set promise's [[PromiseFulfillReactions]] internal slot to a new
    empty List.

5.  Set promise's [[PromiseRejectReactions]] internal slot to a new
    empty List.

6.  Let resolvingFunctions be CreateResolvingFunctions(promise).

7.  Let completion be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
    method of executor with UNDEFINED as thisArgument and
    (resolvingFunctions.[[Resolve]], resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]])
    as argumentsList.

8.  If completion is an abrupt completion, then

    a.  Let status be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal
        method of resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]] with UNDEFINED as
        thisArgument and (completion.[[value]]) as argumentsList.

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

9.  Return promise.

new Promise ( ... argumentsList )

When PROMISE is called as part of a NEW expression it is a constructor:
it initializes a newly created object.

PROMISE called as part of a new expression with argument list
argumentsList performs the following steps:

1.  Let F be the Promise function object on which the NEW operator was
    applied.

2.  Let argumentsList be the argumentsList argument of the
    [[Construct]] internal method that was invoked by the NEW operator.

3.  Return Construct(F, argumentsList).

If Promise is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, its
[[Construct]] internal method will perform the above steps.

Properties of the Promise Constructor

The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the PROMISE constructor
is the FUNCTION prototype object (19.2.3).

Besides the LENGTH property (whose value is 1), the Promise constructor
has the following properties:

Promise.all ( iterable )

of fulfillment values for the passed promises, or rejects with the
reason of the first passed promise that rejects. It resoves all elements
of the passed iterable to promises as it runs this algorithm.

        promiseCapability.[[Reject]])).

    p.  IfAbruptRejectPromise(result, promiseCapability).

    q.  Set index to index + 1.

Note: The ALL function requires its THIS value to be a constructor
function that supports the parameter conventions of the PROMISE
constructor.

Promise.all Resolve Element Functions

A Promise.all resolve element function is an anonymous built-in function
that is used to resolve a specific Promise.all element. Each Promise.all
resolve element function has [[Index]], [[Values]], [[Capabilities]],
[[RemainingElements]], and [[AlreadyCalled]] internal slots.

NOTE The LOAD method differs from the IMPORT method in that it does not
force evaluation of the loaded module.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.module ( source [, options ] )

The MODULE method asynchronously loads, links, and evaluates an
anonymous module from source. The module's dependencies, if any, are
loaded and committed to the registry. The anonymous module itself is not

Reflect.Loader.prototype.newModule ( obj )

TO DO

In the prototype this is the Module Factory Function. However, this
factory seems to have only specialized utility and it seems to
unnecessarily clutter the “global” namespace of Module abstractions.
Making it a method of module loaders seems like a more sanity thing to
do, but we can break it out if that;s what people really want.

Also need to reconcile with are execute factory returns by the
instantiate hook. Is this method intended to be able as an execute
factory. If sho it probably needs to accept multiple arguments.

When the NEWMODULE method is called with argument obj it creates a new
Module objects whose export properties are derived form the properties
of obj. The following steps are performed:

1.  If Type(obj) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

2.  Let mod be CreateLinkedModuleInstance( )

3.  Let keys be the result of calling the ObjectKeys abstract
    operation passing obj as the argument.

as the initial value of the ENTRIES property.

Reflect.Loader.prototype [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"REFLECT.LOADER".

This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: FALSE, [[Enumerable]]:
FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }.

Reflect.Loader Pipeline Hook Properties

Loader hooks are methods that are called at various points in the
process of loading a module. REFLECT.LOADER.PROTOTYPE provides default
implementations for the hook methods. However, individual Loader object
may over-ride these defaults using own properties.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.normalize ( name, refererName, refererAddress )

When the NORMALIZE loader hook is called with arguments name,
refererName, and refererAddress loadRequest, the following steps
are taken:

1.  Assert: Type(name) is String.

2.  Return name.

This is a Loader hook that may be over-ridden by an own property of
Loader instances. The NORMALIZE hook is called once per distinct
ModuleSpecifier String value in a ModuleBody, while the module
ModuleBody with that is being loaded. The name argument is the
StringValue of a ModuleSpecifier.

The NORMALIZE hook returns an eventual String, the normalized module
name, which is used for the rest of the import process. In particular,
the [[Loads]] and [[Modules]] Lists of a ModuleLinkage record are both
keyed by normalized module names. The module registry contains at most
one module for a given normalized module name.

After calling this hook, if the normalized module name is in the
registry or the load table, no new Load Record is created. Otherwise the
loader initiates a load for that module that starts by calling the
LOCATE hook.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.locate ( loadRequest )

When the locate method is called with argument loadRequest the
following steps are taken:

1.  Return the result of Get(loadRequest, "NAME").

This is a Loader hook that may be over-ridden by an own property of
Loader instances. The LOCATE hook is called for each distinct normalized
import ModuleSpecifier immediately after the NORMALIZE hook returns
successfully, unless the module is already loaded or loading.

The LOCATE hook is called to obtain to determine the Loader-dependent
resource address (URL, path, etc.) corresponding to normalized module
name. The resource address is used later in the Loader pipeline to
retrieve the source code of the requested module.

When a LOCATE hook is called by an Loader object the argument
loadRequest is a LoadRequest object (15.2.3.2). The value of the NAME
property is the normalized module name. The LOCATE hook returns an
eventual value that is used as the resource address. When the returned
value is resolved, loading will continue with the FETCH hook.

NOTE The SYSTEM.LOCATE hook typically is significantly more complicated
than the default LOCATE hook.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.fetch ( loadRequest )

When the FETCH loader hook is called with argument loadRequest, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

This is a Loader hook that will normally be over-ridden by an own
property of Loader instances. The FETCH hook is called by a Loader for
all modules whose source code was not directly provided to the Loader.
It is also used to process the IMPORT keyword. The FETCH hook is not
called for module bodies directly provided as arguments to
LOADER.MODULE() or LOADER.DEFINE(). However, the FETCH hook may be
called when loading other modules imported by such modules.

When a FETCH hook is called by an Loader object the argument
loadRequest is a LoadRequest object (15.2.3.2) with an ADDRESS
property. The value of the ADDRESS property identifies the module source
code to fetch. The fetch hook returns an eventual String containing the
source code of the module.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.translate ( loadRequest )

When the translate method is called, the following steps are taken:

1.  Return the result of Get(loadRequest, "SOURCE").

This is a LOADER hook that may be over-ridden by an own property of
Loader instances. The TRANSLATE hook is called for each ModuleBody
including those passed to LOADER.MODULE() or LOADER.DEFINE().The
TRANSLATE hook is called prior to parsing the ModuleBody and provides
a Loader the opportunity to modify or replace the source code that will
be parsed.

NOTE An example of the use of the TRANSLATE hook would be to translate
source code for a another programing language into an ECMAScript
ModuleBody.

When a TRANSLATE hook is called by an Loader object the argument
loadRequest is a LoadRequest object (15.2.3.2) with ADDRESS and SOURCE
properties. The value of the ADDRESS property identifies the module
source code to fetch. The value of the SOURCE property is the resolved
value returned from the FETCH hook. The TRANSLATE hook returns either an
eventual String value ECMAScript that will be parsed as a ModuleBody.

Reflect.Loader.prototype.instantiate ( loadRequest )

When the instantiate loader hook is called with argument loadRequest,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Return UNDEFINED.

This hook allows a Loader to provide interoperability with other module
systems.

When a INSTANTIATE hook is called by an Loader object the argument,
loadRequest, is a LoadRequest object (15.2.3.2) with ADDRESS and
SOURCE properties. loadRequest.NAME, loadRequest.METADATA, and
loadRequest.ADDRESS are the same values passed to the FETCH and
TRANSLATE hooks. loadRequest.SOURCE is the value produced by the
TRANSLATE hook.

If the INSTANTIATE hook returns an eventual UNDEFINED, then the loader
uses the default linking behaviour. It parses loadRequest.SOURCE as a
Module, looks at its imports, loads its dependencies asynchronously, and
finally links them together and adds them to the registry.

Otherwise, the INSTANTIATE hook must return an eventual
instantiationRequest object. An instantiateRequest object has two
required properties. The value of the DEPS property is an array of
strings. Each string is the name of a module upon which the module
identified by loadRequest has dependencies. The value of the EXECUTE
property is a function which the loader will use to create the module
and link it with its clients and dependencies. The function should
expect to receive the same number of arguments as the size of the DEPS
array and must return an eventual Module object. The arguments are
Module objects and have a one-to-one correspondence with elements of the
DEPS array.

The module is evaluated during the linking process. First all of the
modules it depends upon are linked and evaluated , and then passed to
the EXECUTE function. Then the resulting module is linked with the
downstream dependencies.

NOTE This feature is provided in order to permit custom loaders to
support using IMPORT to import pre-ES6 modules such as AMD modules. The
design requires incremental linking when such modules are present, but
it ensures that modules implemented with standard source-level module
declarations can still be statically validated.

Properties of Reflect.Loader Instances

Loader instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties from the
%LoaderPrototype% intrinsic object. Loader instances each have a
[[Loader]] interal slot whose value after initialization is the Loader
Record that the Load instance reflects.

Loader Iterator Objects 

A Loader Iterator object represents a specific iteration over the module
registry of some specific Loader instance object. There is not a named
constructor for Loader Iterator objects. Instead, Loader iterator
objects are created by calling certain methods of Loader instance
objects.

CreateLoaderIterator Abstract Operation

Several methods of Loader objects return Iterator objects. The abstract
operation CreateLoaderIterator with arguments loader and kind is
used to create such iterator objects. It performs the following steps:

1.  Assert: loader is an initialized Loader instance object.

2.  Let iterator be ObjectCreate(%LoaderIteratorPrototype%,
    ([[Loader]], [[LoaderNextIndex]], [[LoaderIterationKind]])).

3.  Set iterator’s [[Loader]] internal slot to loader.

4.  Set iterator’s [[LoaderNextIndex]] internal slot to 0.

5.  Set iterator’s [[LoaderIterationKind]] internal slot to kind.

6.  Return iterator.

The %LoaderIteratorPrototype% Object

All Loader Iterator Objects inherit properties from the
%LoaderIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. The
%LoaderIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object is an ordinary object and its
[[Prototype]] internal slot is the %ObjectPrototype% intrinsic object.
In addition, %LoaderIteratorPrototype% has the following properties:

%LoaderIteratorPrototype%.next ( )

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  If O does not have all of the internal slots of a Loader Iterator
    Instance (26.3.5.3), throw a TYPEERROR exception.

4.  Let m be the value of the [[Loader]] internal slot of O.

5.  Let loaderRecord be m’s [[LoaderRecord]] internal slot.

6.  Let index be the value of the [[LoaderNextIndex]] internal slot of
    O.

7.  Let itemKind be the value of the [[LoaderIterationKind]] internal
    slot of O.

8.  If m is UNDEFINED, then return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED,
    TRUE).

9.  Let entries be the List that is the value of
    loaderRecord.[[Modules]].

10. Repeat while index is less than the total number of elements of
    entries. The number of elements must be redetermined each time
    this method is evaluated.

    a.  Let e be the Record {[[key]], [[value]]} that is the value of
        entries_[_index].

    b.  Set index to index+1;

    c.  Set the [[LoaderNextIndex]] internal slot of O to index.

    d.  If e.[[key]] is not empty, then

        i.  If itemKind is "KEY" then, let result be e.[[key]].

        ii. Else if itemKind is "VALUE" then, let result be
            e.[[value]].

        iii. Else,

            1.  Assert: itemKind is "KEY+VALUE".

            2.  Let result be the result of performing ArrayCreate(2).

            3.  Assert: result is a new, well-formed Array object so
                the following operations will never fail.

            4.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "0", e.[[key]]) .

            5.  Call CreateDataProperty(result, "1", e.[[value]]).

        iv. Return CreateIterResultObject(result, FALSE).

11. Set the [[Loader]] internal slot of O to UNDEFINED.

12. Return CreateIterResultObject(UNDEFINED, TRUE).

NOTE Setting the [[Loader]] internal slot to undefined when the iterator
is exhausted ensures that the same iterator cannot be restarted if new
entries are subsequently added. This condition is tested in step 8.

%LoaderIteratorPrototype% [ @@iterator ] ( )

The following steps are taken:

1.  Return the THIS value.

The value of the NAME property of this function is "[SYMBOL.ITERATOR]".

%LoaderIteratorPrototype% [ @@toStringTag ]

The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string value
"LOADER ITERATOR".

Properties of Loader Iterator Instances

Loader Iterator instances are ordinary objects that inherit properties
from the %LoaderIteratorPrototype% intrinsic object. Loader Iterator
instances are initially created with the internal slots described in
Table 52.

Table 52 — Internal Slots of Loader Iterator Instances

  ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INTERNAL SLOT             DESCRIPTION
  [[Loader]]                The Loader object that is being iterated.
  [[LoaderNextIndex]]       The integer index of the next Loader registry data element to be examined by this iterator.
  [[LoaderIterationKind]]   A string value that identifies what is to be returned for each element of the iteration. The possible values are: "KEY", "VALUE", "KEY+VALUE".
  ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The System Object

The System object is the Loader Object instance associated with the
Realm of the current global object.


Proxy Objects

The Proxy Constructor Function

The Proxy Constructor is a Built-in Function with unique [[Construct]]
behaviour. It is not intended to be subclassed.

The Proxy Constructor does not have a PROTOTYPE property.

The value of the LENGTH property of the Proxy Constructor is 2.

Proxy ( target, handler )

The PROXY function is not intended to be directly called as a function.
If it is called, the following steps are performed:

1.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

new Proxy ( target, handler )

When PROXY is called as part of a NEW expression it is a constructor: it
creates and initializes a new exotic proxy object. PROXY called as part
of a new expression with arguments target and handler performs the
following steps:

1.  Return ProxyCreate(target, handler).

If PROXY is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, it must have a
[[Construct]] internal method that performs the above steps.

Properties of the Proxy Constructor Function

Proxy.revocable ( target, handler )

The PROXY.REVOCABLE function is used to create a revocable Proxy object.
When PROXY.REVOCABLE is called with arguments target and handler the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let p be ProxyCreate(target, handler).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(p).

3.  Let revoker be a new built-in function object as defined in
    26.5.2.1.1.

4.  Set the [[RevokableProxy]] internal slot of revoker to p.

5.  Let result be ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%).

6.  CreateDataProperty(result, "PROXY", p).

7.  CreateDataProperty(result, "REVOKE", revoker).

8.  Return result.

Proxy Revocation Functions

A Proxy revocation function is an anonymous function that has the
ability to invalidate a specific Proxy object.

Each Proxy revocation function has a [[RevokableProxy]] internal slot.

When a Proxy revocation function, F, is called the following steps are
taken:

1.  Let p be the value of F’s [[RevokableProxy]] internal slot.

2.  If p is NULL, then return UNDEFINED.

3.  Set the value of F’s [[RevokableProxy]] internal slot to NULL.

4.  Assert: p is a Proxy object.

5.  Set the [[ProxyTarget]] internal slot of p to NULL.

6.  Set the [[ProxyHandler]] internal slot of p to NULL.

7.  Return UNDEFINED.

1.  PATTERN SEMANTICS

The semantics of 21.2.2 is extended as follows:

Within 21.2.2.5 reference to “Atom :: ( Disjunction )” are to be
interpreted as meaning “Atom :: ( Disjunction )or AtomNoBrace :: (
Disjunction )”.

Term (21.2.2.5) includes the following additional evaluation rule:

  The production Term :: QuantifiableAssertion Quantifier
  evaluates the same as the production Term :: Atom Quantifier but
  with QuantifiableAssertion substituted for Atom.

Atom (21.2.2.8) evaluation rules for the Atom productions except for
Atom :: PatternCharacter are also used for the AtomNoBrace
productions, but with AtomNoBrace substituted for Atom. The
following evaluation rule is also added:

The production AtomNoBrace :: PatternCharacterNoBrace evaluates as
follows:

1.  Let ch be the character represented by PatternCharacterNoBrace.

2.  Let A be a one-element CharSet containing the character ch.

3.  Call CharacterSetMatcher(A, FALSE) and return its Matcher result.

CharacterEscape (21.2.2.10) includes the following additional evaluation
rule:

  The production CharacterEscape :: OctalEscapeSequence evaluates by
  evaluating the CV of the OctalscapeSequence (see B.1.2) and
  returning its character result.

ClassAtom (21.2.2.17) includes the following additional evaluation
rules:

  The production ClassAtomInRange :: - evaluates by returning the
  CharSet containing the one character -.

  The production ClassAtomInRange :: ClassAtomNoDashInRange
  evaluates by evaluating ClassAtomNoDashInRange to obtain a CharSet
  and returning that CharSet.

ClassAtomNoDash (21.2.2.18) includes the following additional evaluation
rules:

  The production ClassAtomNoDashInRange :: SourceCharacter BUT NOT
  ONE OF \ OR ] OR - evaluates by returning a one-element CharSet
  containing the character represented by SourceCharacter.

  The production ClassAtomNoDashInRange :: \ ClassEscape but ony
  if…, evaluates by evaluating ClassEscape to obtain a CharSet and
  returning that CharSet.

  The production ClassAtomNoDashInRange :: \ IdentityEscape
  evaluates by returning the character represented by IdentityEscape.


Additional Built-in Properties

When the ECMAScript host is a web browser the following additional
properties of the standard built-in objects are defined.

1.  Additional Properties of the Global Object

    1.  escape (string)

The ESCAPE function is a property of the global object. It computes a
new version of a String value in which certain code units have been
replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence.

For those code units being replaced whose value is U+00FF or less, a
two-digit escape sequence of the form %xx is used. For those
characters being replaced whose code unit value is greater than U+00FF,
a four-digit escape sequence of the form %Uxxxx is used.

When the ESCAPE function is called with one argument string, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let string be ToString(string).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(string).

3.  Let length be the number of code units in string.

4.  Let R be the empty string.

5.  Let k be 0.

6.  Repeat, while k < length,

    a.  Let char be the code unit (represented as a 16-bit unsigned
        integer) at position k within string.

    b.  If char is the code point of one of the 69 nonblank code units
        in
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789@*_+-./"
        then,

        i.  Let S be a String containing the single code unit char.

    c.  Else if char > 256,

        i.  Let S be a String containing six code units "%Uwxyz"
            where wxyz are the code units of the four hexadecimal
            digits encoding the value of char.

    d.  Else, char < 256

        i.  Let S be a String containing three code units "%xy"
            where xy are the code units of two hexadecimal digits
            encoding the value of char.

    e.  Let R be a new String value computed by concatenating the
        previous value of R and S.

    f.  Increase k by 1.

7.  Return R.

NOTE The encoding is partly based on the encoding described in RFC 1738,
but the entire encoding specified in this standard is described above
without regard to the contents of RFC 1738. This encoding does not
reflect changes to RFC 1738 made by RFC 3986.

unescape (string)

The UNESCAPE function is a property of the global object. It computes a
new version of a String value in which each escape sequence of the sort
that might be introduced by the ESCAPE function is replaced with the
code unit that it represents.

When the UNESCAPE function is called with one argument string, the
following steps are taken:

1.  Let string be ToString(string).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(string).

3.  Let length be the number of code units in string.

4.  Let R be the empty String.

5.  Let k be 0.

6.  Repeat, while k ≠ length

    a.  Let c be the code unit at position k within string.

    b.  If c is %,

        i.  If k ≤ length−6 and the code unit at position k+1
            within string is U and the four code units at positions
            k+2, k+3, k+4, and k+5 within string are all
            hexadecimal digits, then

            1.  Let c be the code unit whose value is the integer
                represented by the four hexadecimal digits at positions
                k+2, k+3, k+4, and k+5 within string.

            2.  Increase k by 5.

        ii. Else if k ≤ length−3 and the two code units at positions
            k+1 and k+2 within string are both hexadecimal digits,
            then

            1.  Let c be the code unit whose value is the integer
                represented by two zeroes plus the two hexadecimal
                digits at positions k+1 and k+2 within string.

            2.  Increase k by 2.

    c.  Let R be a new String value computed by concatenating the
        previous value of R and c.

    d.  Increase k by 1.

7.  Return R.

    1.  Additional Properties of the Object.prototype Object

        1.  Object.prototype._proto_ 

Object.prototype._proto_ is an accessor property with attributes {
[[Enumerable]]: FALSE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE }. The [[Get]] and [[Set]]
attributes are defined as follows

get Object.prototype._proto_ 

The value of the [[Get]] attribute is a built-in function that requires
no arguments. It performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the THIS value as
    the argument.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  Return the result of calling the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method
    of O.

    1.  set Object.prototype._proto_ 

The value of the [[Set]] attribute is a built-in function that takes an
argument proto. It performs the following steps:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(O).

3.  If Type(proto) is neither Object nor Null, then return UNDEFINED.

4.  If Type(O) is not Object, then return UNDEFINED.

5.  Let status be the result of calling the [[SetPrototypeOf]]
    internal method of O with argument proto.

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(status).

7.  If status is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

8.  Return UNDEFINED.

    1.  Additional Properties of the String.prototype Object

        1.  String.prototype.substr (start, length)

The SUBSTR method takes two arguments, start and length, and returns
a substring of the result of converting the THIS object to a String,
starting from position start and running for length code units (or
through the end of the String if length is UNDEFINED). If start is
negative, it is treated as (sourceLength_+_start) where sourceLength
is the length of the String. The result is a String value, not a String
object. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be CheckObjectCoercible(THIS value).

2.  Let S be ToString(O).

3.  Let intStart be ToInteger(start).

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(intStart).

5.  If length is UNDEFINED, let end be +∞; otherwise let end be
    ToInteger(length).

6.  ReturnIfAbrupt(end).

7.  Let size be the number of code units in S.

8.  If intStart is negative, then let intStart be max(size +
    intStart,0).

9.  Let resultLength be min(max(end,0), size – intStart).

10. If resultLength ≤ 0, return the empty String "".

11. Return a String containing resultLength consecutive code units
    from S beginning with the code unit at position intStart.

The LENGTH property of the SUBSTR method is 2.

NOTE The SUBSTR function is intentionally generic; it does not require
that its THIS value be a String object. Therefore it can be transferred
to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

String.prototype.anchor ( name )

When the ANCHOR method is called with argument name, the following
steps are taken:

1.  Let S be the THIS value.

2.  Return CreateHTML(S, "A", "NAME", name).

    1.  CreateHTML ( name ) Abstract Operation

The abstract operation CreateHTML is called with arguments _string,
tag_, attribute, and value. The arguments tag and attribute must
be string values. The following steps are taken:

1.  Let str be CheckObjectCoercible(string).

2.  Let S be ToString(str).

3.  ReturnIfAbrupt(S).

4.  Let p1 be the string value that is the concatenation of "<" and
    tag.

5.  If attribute is not the empty String, then

    a.  Let V be ToString(value).

    b.  ReturnIfAbrupt(V).

    c.  Let escapedV be the string value that is the same as V
        except that each occurrence of the code unit U+0022 (QUOTATION
        MARK) in V has been replaced with the six code unit sequence
        "&QUOT;".

    d.  Let p1 be the string value that is the concatenation of the
        following string values:

-   The string value of p1

-   Code unit U+0020 (SPACE)

-   The string value of attribute

-   Code unit U+003D (EQUALS SIGN)

-   Code unit U+0022 (QUOTATION MARK)

-   The string value of escapedV

-   Code unit U+0022 (QUOTATION MARK)

1.  Let p2 be the string value that is the concatenation of p1 and
    ">".

2.  Let p3 be the string value that is the concatenation of p2 and
    S.

3.  Let p4 be the string value that is the concatenation of p3,
    "</", tag, and ">".

4.  Return p4.

    1.  String.prototype.big ()

    1.  Additional Properties of the Date.prototype Object

        1.  Date.prototype.getYear ( )

NOTE The GETFULLYEAR method is preferred for nearly all purposes,
because it avoids the “year 2000 problem.”

When the GETYEAR method is called with no arguments, the following steps
are taken:

    1.  Date.prototype.toGMTString ( )

NOTE The property TOUTCSTRING is preferred. The TOGMTSTRING property is
provided principally for compatibility with old code. It is recommended
that the TOUTCSTRING property be used in new ECMAScript code.

The Function object that is the initial value of
DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOGMTSTRING is the same Function object that is the
initial value of DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOUTCSTRING.

1.  Additional Properties of the RegExp.prototype Object

    1.  RegExp.prototype.compile (pattern, flags )

When the COMPILE method is called with arguments pattern and flags,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Let O be the THIS value.

2.  If Type(O) is not Object or Type(O) is Object and O does not
    have a [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot, then

    a.  Throw a TYPEERROR exception.

3.  Let extensible be the result of calling the [[IsExtensible]]
    internal method of O.

4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(extensible).

5.  If extensible is FALSE, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

6.  If Type(pattern) is Object and pattern has a [[RegExpMatcher]]
    internal slot, then

    a.  If the value of pattern’s [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot is
        UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    b.  If flags is not UNDEFINED, then throw a TYPEERROR exception.

    c.  Let P be the value of pattern’s [[OriginalSource]] internal
        slot.

    d.  Let F be the value of pattern’s [[OriginalFlags]] internal
        slot.

7.  Else,

    a.  Let P be pattern.

    b.  Let F be flags.

8.  Return RegExpInitialize(O, P, F).

NOTE The COMPILE method completely reinitializes the THIS object RegExp
with a new pattern and flags. An implementaton may interpret use of this
method as an assertion that the resulting RegExp object will be used
multiple times and hence is a candidate for extra optimization.

    Other Additional Features

    1.  _proto_ Property Names in Object Initializers

The following Early Error rule is added to those in 12.2.5.1:

ObjectLiteral : { PropertyDefinitionList }

and

ObjectLiteral : { PropertyDefinitionList , }

-   It is a Syntax Error if PropertyNameList of PropertyDefinitionList
    contains any duplicate entries for "_PROTO_" and at least two of
    those entries were obtained from productions of the form
    PropertyDefinition : PropertyName : AssignmentExpression.

In 12.2.5.9 the PropertyDefinitionEvaluation algorithm for the
production PropertyDefinition : PropertyName :
AssignmentExpression is replaced with the following:

PropertyDefinition : PropertyName : AssignmentExpression

1.  Let propKey be the result of evaluating PropertyName.

2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(propKey).

3.  Let exprValueRef be the result of evaluating
    AssignmentExpression.

4.  Let propValue be GetValue(exprValueRef).

5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(propValue).

6.  If propKey is the string value "_PROTO_" and if
    IsComputedPropertyKey(propKey) is FALSE, then

    a.  If Type(propValue) is either Object or Null, then

        i.  Return the result of calling the [[SetPrototypeOf]] internal
            method of object with argument propValue.

    b.  Return NormalCompletion(empty).

7.  If IsFunctionDefinition(AssignmentExpression) is TRUE, then

    a.  Assert: propValue is an ECMAScript function object.

    b.  Let referencesSuper be the value of propValue’s
        [[NeedsSuper]] internal slot.

    c.  Let thisMode be the value of propValue’s [[ThisMode]]
        internal slot.

    d.  If thisMode is not lexical and referencesSuper is TRUE, then

        i.  If propValue’s [[HomeObject]] internal slot is UNDEFINED,
            then

            1.  Assert: AssignmentExpression is not a class definition
                whose constructor references SUPER.

            2.  Set the propValue’s [[HomeObject]] internal slot to
                object.

            3.  Set the propValue’s [[MethodName]] internal slot to
                propKey.

    e.  If IsAnonymousFunctionDefinition(AssignmentExpression) is
        TRUE, then

        i.  SetFunctionName(propValue, propKey).

        ii. Assert: SetFunctionName will not return an abrupt
            completion.

8.  Let desc be the Property Descriptor{[[Value]]: propValue,
    [[Writable]]: TRUE, [[Enumerable]]: TRUE, [[Configurable]]: TRUE}

9.  Return DefinePropertyOrThrow(object, propKey, desc).

    1.  Labelled Function Declarations

Prior to the Sixth Edition, the ECMAScript specification
LabelledStatement did not allow for the association of a statement
label with a FunctionDeclaration. However, a labelled
FunctionDeclaration was an allowable extension for non-strict mode
code and most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations supported that
extension. In the Sixth Edition, the grammar productions for
LabelledStatement permits use of FunctionDeclaration as a
LabelledItem but 13.12.1 includes an Early Error rule that produces a
Syntax Error if that occurs. For web browser compatibility, that rule is
modified with the addition of the underlined text:

LabelledItem : FunctionDeclaration

-   It is a Syntax Error if any strict mode source code matches this
    rule.

    1.  Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics 

Prior to the Sixth Edition, the ECMAScript specification did not define
the occurrence of a FunctionDeclaration as an element of a Block
statement’s StatementList. However, support for that form of
FunctionDeclaration was an allowable extension and most browser-hosted
ECMAScript implementations permitted them. Unfortunately, the semantics
of such declarations differ among those implementations. Because of
these semantic differences, existing web ECMAScript code that uses
Block level function declarations is only portable among browser
implementation if the usage only depends upon the semantic intersection
of all of the browser implementations for such declarations. The
following are the use cases that fall within that intersection
semantics:

1.  A function is declared and only referenced within a single block

    -   A function declaration with the name f is declared exactly
        once within the function code of an enclosing function g and
        that declaration is nested within a Block.

    -   No other declaration of f that is not a VAR declaration occurs
        within the function code of g

    -   All references to f occur within the StatementList of the
        Block containing the declaration of f.

2.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single Block but
    also referenced by an inner function definition that is not
    contained within that same Block.

    -   A function declaration with the name f is declared exactly
        once within the function code of an enclosing function g and
        that declaration is nested within a Block.

    -   No other declaration of f that is not a VAR declaration occurs
        within the function code of g

    -   References to f may occur within the StatementList of the
        Block containing the declaration of f.

    -   References to f occur within the function code of g that
        lexically follows the Block containing the declaration of f.

3.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single block but
    also referenced within subsequent blocks.

    -   A function declaration with the name f is declared exactly
        once within the function code of an enclosing function g and
        that declaration is nested within a Block.

    -   No other declaration of f that is not a VAR declaration occurs
        within the function code of g

    -   References to f may occur within the StatementList of the
        Block containing the declaration of f.

    -   References to f occur within another function h that is
        nested within g and no other declaration of f shadows the
        references to f from within h.

    -   All invocations of h occur after the declaration of f has
        been evaluated.

The first use case is interoperable with the semantics of Block level
function declarations provided by ECMA-262 Edition 6. Any pre-existing
ECMAScript code that employees that use case will operate using the
Block level function declarations semantics defined by clauses 9, 13,
and 14 of this specification.

Sixth edition interoperability for the second and third use cases
requires the following extensions to the clause 9 and clause 14
semantics. These extensions are applied to each non-strict mode function
g for each FunctionDeclaration f that is directly contained in the
StatementList of a Block, CaseClause, or DefaultClause that is
part of the function code of g

1.  Let F be StringValue of the BindingIdentifier of
    FunctionDeclaration f.

2.  If replacing the FunctionDeclaration f with a
    VariableStatement that has F as a BindingIdentifier would not
    produce any Early Errors for g, then

    a.  During FunctionDeclarationInstantiation (9.2.13) for g perform
        the following steps immediately before performing step 25:

        i.  ii. NOTE A var binding for F is only instantiated here if
            it is not also a VarDeclaredName, the name of a formal
            parameter, or another FunctionDeclarations.

        iii. If instantiatedVarNames does not contain F, then

            1.  Let status be the result of calling bodyEnv’s
                CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing F as the
                argument.

            2.  3.  Assert: status is never an abrupt completion.

            4.  Call the InitializeBinding concrete method of bodyEnv
                with arguments F and UNDEFINED.

            5.  Append F to instantiatedVarNames.

    b.  In place of the FunctionDeclaration Evaluation algorithm
        provide in 14.1.22, perform the following steps to evaluate the
        FunctionDeclaration f:

        1.  Let fenv be the running execution context’s
            VariableEnvironment.

        2.  Let benv be the running execution context’s
            LexicalEnvironment.

        3.  Let fobj be the result of calling the GetBindingValue
            concrete method of benv with arguments F and FALSE.

        4.  ReturnIfAbrupt(fobj).

        i.  1.  Let status be the result of calling fenv’s
                SetMutableBinding concrete method with arguments F,
                fobj, and FALSE.

            2.  Assert: status is never an abrupt completion.

            3.  Return NormalCompletion(empty).

If an ECMAScript implementation has a mechanism for reporting diagnostic
warning messages, a warning should be produced for each function g
whose function code contains a FunctionDeclaration for which steps 2.a
and 2.b above will be performed.

FunctionDeclarations in IfStatement Statement Clauses.

The following rules for IfStatement augment those in 13.5:

IfStatement~[Yield,\ Return]~ :

IF ( Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ) FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~ ELSE
Statement~[?Yield,\ ?Return]~
IF ( Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ) Statement~[?Yield,\ ?Return]~ ELSE
FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~
IF ( Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ) FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~ ELSE
FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~
IF ( Expression~[In,\ ?Yield]~ ) FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~

The above rules are only applied when parsing non-strict mode code. If
any non-strict code is match by one of these rules subsequent processing
of that code takes places as if each matching occurrence of
FunctionDeclaration~[?Yield]~ was the sole StatementListItem of a
BlockStatement occupying that position in the source code. The
semantics of such a synthetic BlockStatement includes the web legacy
compatibility semantics specified in B.3.3.

VariableStatements in Catch blocks

The content of subclause 13.14.1 is replaced with the following:

Catch : CATCH ( CatchParameter ) Block

-   It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of
    CatchParameter also occurs in the LexicallyDeclaredNames of
    Block.

-   It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of
    CatchParameter also occurs in the VarDeclaredNames of Block,
    unless that element is only bound by a VariableStatment or the
    VariableDeclarationList of a for statement, or the ForBinding of
    a for-in statement.

NOTE The Block of a Catch clause may contain VAR declarations that
bind a name that is also bound by the CatchParameter. At runtime, such
bindings are instantiated in the VariableDeclarationEnvironment. They do
not shadow the same-named bindings introduced by the CatchParameter
and hence the Initializer for such VAR declarations will assign to the
corresponding catch parameter rather than the VAR binding. The
relaxation of the normal static semantic rule does not apply to names
only bound by for-of statements.

(informative)
The Strict Mode of ECMAScript

THE STRICT MODE RESTRICTION AND EXCEPTIONS

-   Use of the identifiers "IMPLEMENTS", "INTERFACE", "PACKAGE",
      "PRIVATE", "PROTECTED", "PUBLIC", and "STATIC" is prohibited
      within strict mode code. (11.6.2.2).

-   A conforming implementation, when processing strict mode code, may
      not extend the syntax of NumericLiteral (11.8.3) to include
      LegacyOctalIntegerLiteral as described in B.1.1.

-   A conforming implementation, when processing strict mode code (see
      10.2.1), may not extend the syntax of EscapeSequence to include
      LegacyOctalEscapeSequence as described in B.1.2.

-   Assignment to an undeclared identifier or otherwise unresolvable
      reference does not create a property in the global object. When a
      simple assignment occurs within strict mode code, its
      LeftHandSide must not evaluate to an unresolvable Reference. If
      it does a REFERENCEERROR exception is thrown (6.2.3.2). The
      LeftHandSide also may not be a reference to a data property with
      the attribute value {[[Writable]]:FALSE}, to an accessor property
      with the attribute value {[[Set]]:UNDEFINED}, nor to a
      non-existent property of an object whose [[Extensible]] internal
      slot has the value FALSE. In these cases a TYPEERROR exception is
      thrown (12.14).

-   The identifier EVAL or ARGUMENTS may not appear as the
      LeftHandSideExpression of an Assignment operator (12.14) or of a
      PostfixExpression (12.14) or as the UnaryExpression operated
      upon by a Prefix Increment (12.5.7) or a Prefix Decrement (12.5.8)
      operator.

-   Arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable
      accessor properties named "CALLER" and "CALLEE" which throw a
      TYPEERROR exception on access (9.2.8).

-   Arguments objects for strict mode functions do not dynamically share
      their array indexed property values with the corresponding formal
      parameter bindings of their functions. (9.4.4).

-   For strict mode functions, if an arguments object is created the
      binding of the local identifier ARGUMENTS to the arguments object
      is immutable and hence may not be the target of an assignment
      expression. (9.2.13).

-   It is a SYNTAXERROR if the IdentifierName EVAL or the
      IdentifierName ARGUMENTS occurs as a BindingIdentifier within
      strict mode code (12.1.1).

-   -   -   Strict mode eval code cannot instantiate variables or
      functions in the variable environment of the caller to eval.
      Instead, a new variable environment is created and that
      environment is used for declaration binding instantiation for the
      eval code (18.2.1).

-   If THIS is evaluated within strict mode code, then the THIS value is
      not coerced to an object. A THIS value of NULL or UNDEFINED is not
      converted to the global object and primitive values are not
      converted to wrapper objects. The THIS value passed via a function
      call (including calls made using FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.APPLY and
      FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.CALL) do not coerce the passed this value to an
      object (8.3.2, 12.2.1, 19.2.3.1, 0).

-   When a DELETE operator occurs within strict mode code, a SYNTAXERROR
      is thrown if its UnaryExpression is a direct reference to a
      variable, function argument, or function name (12.5.4).

-   When a DELETE operator occurs within strict mode code, a TYPEERROR
      is thrown if the property to be deleted has the attribute {
      [[Configurable]]:FALSE } (12.5.4).

-   -   Strict mode code may not include a WithStatement. The
      occurrence of a WithStatement in such a context is a SYNTAXERROR
      (13.10).

-   It is a SYNTAXERROR if a TryStatement with a Catch occurs within
      strict code and the Identifier of the Catch production is EVAL
      or ARGUMENTS (13.14)

-   -   It is a SYNTAXERROR if the same BindingIdentifier appears more
      than once in the FormalParameters of a strict mode function. An
      attempt to create such a function using a FUNCTION or GENERATOR
      constructor is a SYNTAXERROR (14.1.2, 19.2.1, 25.2.1).

-   An implementation may not extend, beyond that defined in this
      specification, the meanings within strict mode functions of
      properties named CALLER or ARGUMENTS of function instances.
      ECMAScript code may not create or modify properties with these
      names on function objects that correspond to strict mode functions
      (9.2.1, 9.4.4).

-   It is a SYNTAXERROR if the IdentifierName EVAL or the
      IdentifierName ARGUMENTS occurs as as the BindingIdentifier of
      a FunctionDeclaration, FunctionExpression,
      GeneratorDeclaration, or GeneratorExpression (12.1.1, 14.1.2,
      14.4.1).

Corrections and Clarifications with Possible Compatibility Impact


In Edition 6

9.1.4.2.1, 9.1.4.2.2: The 5^th^ Edition moved the capture of the current
array length prior to the integer conversion of the array index or new
length value. However, the captured length value could become invalid if
the conversion process has the side-effect of changing the array length.
The 6^th^ Edition specifies that the current array length must be
captured after the possible occurrence of such side-effects.

20.3.1.14: Previous editions permitted the TimeClip abstract operation
to return either +0 or −0 as the representation of a 0 time value. The
6^th^ Edition specifies that +0 always returned. This means that for the
6^th^ Edition the time value of a Date object is never observably −0 and
methods that return time values never return −0.

20.3.1.15: If a time zone offset is not present, the local time zone is
used. Edition 5.1 incorrectly stated that a missing time zone should be
interpreted as “z”.

20.3.4.36: If the year cannot be represented using the Date Time String
Format specified in 20.3.1.15 a RangeError exception is thrown. Previous
editions did not specify the behaviour for that case.

20.3.4.41: Previous editions did not specify the value returned by
Date.prototype.toString when this time value is NaN. The 6^th^ Edition
specifies the result to be the String value is "INVALID DATE".

21.2.3.1, 21.2.3.3.4: If any LineTerminator code points in the value of
the SOURCE property of an RegExp instance must be expressed using an
escape sequence. Edition 5.1 only required the escaping of "/".

22.1.3.24, 22.1.3.24.1 Previous editions did not specify how a NAN value
returned by a comparefn was interpreted by ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SORT.
Edition 6 specifies that such as value is treated as if +0 was returned
from the comparefn.


In Edition 5.1

Clause references in this list refer to the clause numbers used in
Edition 5.1.

7.8.4: CV definitions added for DoubleStringCharacter ::
LineContinuation and SingleStringCharacter :: LineContinuation.

10.2.1.1.3: The argument S is not ignored. It controls whether an
exception is thrown when attempting to set an immutable binding.

10.2.1.2.2: In algorithm step 5, TRUE is passed as the last argument to
[[DefineOwnProperty]].

10.5: Former algorithm step 5.e is now 5.f and a new step 5.e was added
to restore compatibility with 3^rd^ Edition when redefining global
functions.

11.5.3: In the final bullet item, use of IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode
is specified.

12.6.3: Missing ToBoolean restored in step 3.a.ii of both algorithms.

12.6.4: Additional final sentences in each of the last two paragraphs
clarify certain property enumeration requirements.

12.7, 12.8, 12.9: BNF modified to clarify that a CONTINUE or BREAK
statement without an Identifier or a RETURN statement without an
Expression may have a LineTerminator before the semi-colon.

12.14: Step 3 of algorithm 1 and step 2.a of algorithm 3 are corrected
such that the value field of B is passed as a parameter rather than
B itself.

15.1.2.2: In step 2 of algorithm, clarify that S may be the empty
string.

15.1.2.3: In step 2 of algorithm clarify that trimmedString may be the
empty string.

15.1.3: Added notes clarifying that ECMAScript’s URI syntax is based
upon RFC 2396 and not the newer RFC 3986. In the algorithm for Decode, a
step was removed that immediately preceded the current step 4.d.vii.10.a
because it tested for a condition that cannot occur.

15.2.3.7: Corrected use of variable P in steps 5 and 6 of algorithm.

15.2.4.2: Edition 5 handling of UNDEFINED and NULL as THIS value caused
existing code to fail. Specification modified to maintain compatibility
with such code. New steps 1 and 2 added to the algorithm.

15.3.3.3: Steps 5 and 7 of Edition 5 algorithm have been deleted because
they imposed requirements upon the argArray argument that are
inconsistent with other uses of generic array-like objects.

15.4.3.12: In step 9.a, incorrect reference to relativeStart was
replaced with a reference to actualStart.

15.4.3.15: Clarified that the default value for fromIndex is the
length minus 1 of the array.

15.4.3.18: In step 10 (corresponding to step 8 in 5.1) of the algorithm,
UNDEFINED is now the specified return value.

15.4.3.22: In step 11.d.iii (corresponding to 9.c.ii in 5.1) the first
argument to the [[Call]] internal method has been changed to UNDEFINED
for consistency with the definition of Array.prototype.reduce.

15.4.5.1: In Algorithm steps 3.l.ii and 3.l.iii the variable name was
inverted resulting in an incorrectly inverted test.

15.5.4.9: Normative requirement concerning canonically equivalent
strings deleted from paragraph following algorithm because it is listed
as a recommendation in NOTE 2.

15.5.4.14: In split algorithm step 11.a and 13.a, the positional order
of the arguments to SplitMatch was corrected to match the actual
parameter signature of SplitMatch. In step 13.a.iii.7.d, lengthA
replaces A.length.

15.5.5.2: In first paragraph, removed the implication that the
individual character property access had “array index” semantics.
Modified algorithm steps 3 and 5 such that they do not enforce “array
index” requirement.

15.9.1.15: Specified legal value ranges for fields that lacked them.
Eliminated “time-only” formats. Specified default values for all
optional fields.

15.10.2.2: The step numbers of the algorithm for the internal closure
produced by step 2 were incorrectly numbered in a manner that implied
that they were steps of the outer algorithm.

15.10.2.6: In the abstract operation IsWordChar the first character in
the list in step 3 is “A” rather than “A”.

15.10.2.8: In the algorithm for the closure returned by the abstract
operation CharacterSetMatcher, the variable defined by step 3 and passed
as an argument in step 4 was renamed to ch in order to avoid a name
conflict with a formal parameter of the closure.

15.10.6.2: Step 9.e was deleted because It performed an extra increment
of i.

15.11.1.1: Removed requirement that the message own property is set to
the empty String when the message argument is UNDEFINED.

15.11.1.2: Removed requirement that the message own property is set to
the empty String when the message argument is UNDEFINED.

15.11.4.4: Steps 6-10 modified/added to correctly deal with missing or
empty message property value.

15.11.1.2: Removed requirement that the message own property is set to
the empty String when the message argument is UNDEFINED.

15.12.3: In step 10.b.iii of the JA abstract operation, the last
element of the concatenation is “]”.

B.2.1: Added to NOTE that the encoding is based upon RFC 1738 rather
than the newer RFC 3986.

Annex C: An item was added corresponding to 7.6.12 regarding
FutureReservedWords in strict mode.


In Edition 5

Clause references in this list refer to the clause numbers used in
Edition 5.

Throughout: In the Edition 3 specification the meaning of phrases such
as “as if by the expression NEW ARRAY()” are subject to
misinterpretation. In the Edition 5 specification text for all internal
references and invocations of standard built-in objects and methods has
been clarified by making it explicit that the intent is that the actual
built-in object is to be used rather than the current dynamically
resolved value of the correspondingly identifier binding.

11.8.1: ECMAScript generally uses a left to right evaluation order,
however the Edition 3 specification language for the > and <= operators
resulted in a partial right to left order. The specification has been
corrected for these operators such that it now specifies a full left to
right evaluation order. However, this change of order is potentially
observable if side-effects occur during the evaluation process.

11.1.4: Edition 5 clarifies the fact that a trailing comma at the end of
an ArrayInitialiser does not add to the length of the array. This is
not a semantic change from Edition 3 but some implementations may have
previously misinterpreted this.

11.2.3: Edition 5 reverses the order of steps 2 and 3 of the algorithm.
The original order as specified in Editions 1 through 3 was incorrectly
specified such that side-effects of evaluating Arguments could affect
the result of evaluating MemberExpression.

12.4: In Edition 3, an object is created, as if by NEW OBJECT()to serve
as the scope for resolving the name of the exception parameter passed to
a CATCH clause of a TRY statement. If the actual exception object is a
function and it is called from within the CATCH clause, the scope object
will be passed as the THIS value of the call. The body of the function
can then define new properties on its THIS value and those property
names become visible identifiers bindings within the scope of the CATCH
clause after the function returns. In Edition 5, when an exception
parameter is called as a function, UNDEFINED is passed as the THIS
value.

Additions and Changes That
Introduce Incompatibilities with Prior Editions


In the 6^th^ Edition

9: In Edition 6, Function calls are not allowed to return a Reference
value.

12.2.5.1: Early error relating to duplicate property names in Object
Initializers have been eliminated in Editon 6.

13.6: In Edition 6, a terminating semi-colon is no longer required at
the end of a do-while statement.

13.6: Prior to Edition 6, an initialization expression could appear as
part of the VariableDeclaration that precedes the IN keyword. The
value of that expression was always discarded. In Edition 6, the
ForBind in that same position does not allow the occurance of such an
initializer.

13.14: In Edition 6, it is an early error for a Catch clause to
contained a VAR declaration for the same Identifier that appears as
the Catch clause parameter. In previous editions, such a variable
declaration would be instantiated in the enclosing variable environment
but the declaration’s Initializer value would be assigned to the
Catch parameter.

14.3 In Edition 6, the function objects that are created as the values
of the [[Get]] or [[Set]] attribute of accessor properties in an
ObjectLiteral are not constructor functions. In Edition 5, they were
constructors.

19.1.2.2 and 19.1.2.3: In Edition 6, all property additions and changes
are processed, even if one of them throws an exception. If an exception
occurs during such processing, the first such exception is thrown after
all propertie are processed. In Edition 5, processing of property
additions and changes immediately terminated when the first exception
occurred.

19.1.2.5: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.FREEZE is not an
object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with
no own properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.6: In Edition 6, if the argument to
OBJECT.GETOWNPROPERTYDESCRIPTOR is not an object an attempt is make to
coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coerecion is successful the
result is used in place of the original argument value. In Edition 5, a
non-object argument always causes a TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.7: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.GETOWNPROPERTYNAMES is
not an object an attempt is make to coerce the argument using ToObject.
If the coerecion is successful the result is used in place of the
original argument value. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always
causes a TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.9: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.GETPROTOTYPEOF is not
an object an attempt is make to coerce the argument using ToObject. If
the coerecion is successful the result is used in place of the original
argument value. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.11: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.ISEXTENSIBLE is not
an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object
with no own properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always
causes a TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.12: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.ISFROZEN is not an
object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with
no own properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.13: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.ISSEALED is not an
object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with
no own properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.14: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.KEYS is not an object
an attempt is make to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the
coerecion is successful the result is used in place of the original
argument value. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.15: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.PREVENTEXTENSIONS is
not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary
object with no own properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument
always causes a TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.1.2.17: In Edition 6, if the argument to OBJECT.SEAL is not an object
it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own
properties. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a
TYPEERROR to be thrown.

19.2.4.1: In Edition 6, the LENGTH property of function instances is
configurable. In previous editions it was non-configurable.

19.3.3 In Edition 6, the Boolean prototype object is not a Boolean
instance. In previous editions it was a Boolean instance whose Boolean
value was FALSE.

20.1.3 In Edition 6, the Number prototype object is not a Number
instance. In previous editions it was a Number instance whose number
value was +0.

20.3.4 In Edition 6, the Date prototype object is not a Date instance.
In previous editions it was a Date instance whose TimeValue was NaN.

22.1.3 In Edition 6, the Array prototype object is not an Array
instance. In previous editions it was an Array instance with a length
property whose value was +0.

21.1.3 In Edition 6, the String prototype object is not a String
instance. In previous editions it was a String instance whose String
value was the empty string.

21.1.3.22 and 21.1.3.24 In Edition 6, lowercase/upper conversion
processing operates on code points. In previous editions such the
conversion processing was only applied to individual code units. The
only affected code points are those in the Deseret block of Unicode

21.1.3.25 In Edition 6, the STRING.PROTOTYPE.TRIM method is defined to
recognize white space code points that may exists outside of the Unicode
BMP. However, as of Unicode 6.1 no such code points are defined. In
previous editions such code points would not have been recognized as
white space.

21.2.5 In Edition 6, the RegExp prototype object is not a RegExp
instance. In previous editions it was a RegExp instance whose pattern is
the empty string.

21.2.5 In Edition 6, SOURCE, GLOBAL, IGNORECASE, and MULTILINE are
accessor properties defined on the RegExp prototype object. In previous
editions they were data properties defined on RegExp instances.

22.1.3 In Edition 6, the Array prototype object is not an Array
instance. In previous editions it was an Array instance with a length
property whose value was +0.


In the 5^th^ Edition

Clause references in this list refer to the clause numbers used in
Edition 5 and 5.1.

7.1: Unicode format control s are no longer stripped from ECMAScript
source text before processing. In Edition 5, if such a character appears
in a StringLiteral or RegularExpressionLiteral the character will be
incorporated into the literal where in Edition 3 the character would not
be incorporated into the literal.

7.2: Unicode character <BOM> is now treated as whitespace and its
presence in the middle of what appears to be an identifier could result
in a syntax error which would not have occurred in Edition 3

7.3: Line terminator characters that are preceded by an escape sequence
are now allowed within a string literal token. In Edition 3 a syntax
error would have been produced.

7.8.5: Regular expression literals now return a unique object each time
the literal is evaluated. This change is detectable by any programs that
test the object identity of such literal values or that are sensitive to
the shared side effects.

7.8.5: Edition 5 requires early reporting of any possible RegExp
constructor errors that would be produced when converting a
RegularExpressionLiteral to a RegExp object. Prior to Edition 5
implementations were permitted to defer the reporting of such errors
until the actual execution time creation of the object.

7.8.5: In Edition 5 unescaped “/” characters may appear as a
CharacterClass in a regular expression literal. In Edition 3 such a
character would have been interpreted as the final character of the
literal.

10.4.2: In Edition 5, indirect calls to the EVAL function use the global
environment as both the variable environment and lexical environment for
the eval code. In Edition 3, the variable and lexical environments of
the caller of an indirect EVAL was used as the environments for the eval
code.

15.4.3: In Edition 5 all methods of ARRAY.PROTOTYPE are intentionally
generic. In Edition 3 TOSTRING and TOLOCALESTRING were not generic and
would throw a TYPEERROR exception if applied to objects that were not
instances of Array.

10.6: In Edition 5 the array indexed properties of argument objects that
correspond to actual formal parameters are enumerable. In Edition 3,
such properties were not enumerable.

10.6: In Edition 5 the value of the [[Class]] internal slot of an
arguments object is "ARGUMENTS". In Edition 3, it was "OBJECT". This is
observable if TOSTRING is called as a method of an arguments object.

12.6.4: for-in statements no longer throw a TYPEERROR if the IN
expression evaluates to NULL or UNDEFINED. Instead, the statement
behaves as if the value of the expression was an object with no
enumerable properties.

15: In Edition 5, the following new properties are defined on built-in
objects that exist in Edition 3: OBJECT.GETPROTOTYPEOF,
OBJECT.GETOWNPROPERTYDESCRIPTOR, OBJECT.GETOWNPROPERTYNAMES,
OBJECT.CREATE, OBJECT.DEFINEPROPERTY, OBJECT.DEFINEPROPERTIES,
OBJECT.SEAL, OBJECT.FREEZE, OBJECT.PREVENTEXTENSIONS, OBJECT.ISSEALED,
OBJECT.ISFROZEN, OBJECT.ISEXTENSIBLE, OBJECT.KEYS,
FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.BIND, ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.INDEXOF,
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.LASTINDEXOF, ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.EVERY,
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.SOME, ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.FOREACH, ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.MAP,
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.FILTER, ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.REDUCE,
ARRAY.PROTOTYPE.REDUCERIGHT, STRING.PROTOTYPE.TRIM, DATE.NOW,
DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOISOSTRING, DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOJSON.

15: Implementations are now required to ignore extra arguments to
standard built-in methods unless otherwise explicitly specified. In
Edition 3 the handling of extra arguments was unspecified and
implementations were explicitly allowed to throw a TYPEERROR exception.

15.1.1: The value properties NAN, INFINITY, and UNDEFINED of the Global
Object have been changed to be read-only properties.

15.1.2.1. Implementations are no longer permitted to restrict the use of
eval in ways that are not a direct call. In addition, any invocation of
eval that is not a direct call uses the global environment as its
variable environment rather than the caller’s variable environment.

15.1.2.2: The specification of the function PARSEINT no longer allows
implementations to treat Strings beginning with a 0 as octal values.

15.3.3.3: In Edition 3, a TYPEERROR is thrown if the second argument
passed to FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.APPLY is neither an array object nor an
arguments object. In Edition 5, the second argument may be any kind of
generic array-like object that has a valid LENGTH property.

15.3.3.3, 15.3.3.4: In Edition 3 passing UNDEFINED or NULL as the first
argument to either FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.APPLY or FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.CALL
causes the global object to be passed to the indirectly invoked target
function as the THIS value. If the first argument is a primitive value
the result of calling ToObject on the primitive value is passed as the
THIS value. In Edition 5, these transformations are not performed and
the actual first argument value is passed as the THIS value. This
difference will normally be unobservable to existing ECMAScript Edition
3 code because a corresponding transformation takes place upon
activation of the target function. However, depending upon the
implementation, this difference may be observable by host object
functions called using APPLY or CALL. In addition, invoking a standard
built-in function in this manner with NULL or UNDEFINED passed as the
THIS value will in many cases cause behaviour in Edition 5
implementations that differ from Edition 3 behaviour. In particular, in
Edition 5 built-in functions that are specified to actually use the
passed THIS value as an object typically throw a TYPEERROR exception if
passed NULL or UNDEFINED as the THIS value.

15.3.4.2: In Edition 5, the PROTOTYPE property of Function instances is
not enumerable. In Edition 3, this property was enumerable.

15.5.5.2: In Edition 5, the individual characters of a String object’s
[[StringData]] may be accessed as array indexed properties of the String
object. These properties are non-writable and non-configurable and
shadow any inherited properties with the same names. In Edition 3, these
properties did not exist and ECMAScript code could dynamically add and
remove writable properties with such names and could access inherited
properties with such names.

15.9.4.2: DATE.PARSE is now required to first attempt to parse its
argument as an ISO format string. Programs that use this format but
depended upon implementation specific behaviour (including failure) may
behave differently.

15.10.2.12: In Edition 5, \S now additionally matches <BOM>.

15.10.4.1: In Edition 3, the exact form of the String value of the
SOURCE property of an object created by the REGEXP constructor is
implementation defined. In Edition 5, the String must conform to certain
specified requirements and hence may be different from that produced by
an Edition 3 implementation.

15.10.6.4: In Edition 3, the result of REGEXP.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING need
not be derived from the value of the RegExp object’s SOURCE property. In
Edition 5 the result must be derived from the SOURCE property in a
specified manner and hence may be different from the result produced by
an Edition 3 implementation.

15.11.2.1, 15.11.4.3: In Edition 5, if an initial value for the MESSAGE
property of an Error object is not specified via the ERROR constructor
the initial value of the property is the empty String. In Edition 3,
such an initial value is implementation defined.

15.11.4.4: In Edition 3, the result of ERROR.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING is
implementation defined. In Edition 5, the result is fully specified and
hence may differ from some Edition 3 implementations.

15.12: In Edition 5, the name JSON is defined in the global environment.
In Edition 3, testing for the presence of that name will show it to be
UNDEFINED unless it is defined by the program or implementation.
